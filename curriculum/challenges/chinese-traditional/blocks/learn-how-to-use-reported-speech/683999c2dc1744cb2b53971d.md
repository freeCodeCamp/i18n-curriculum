想像有人為 Lisa 和 Mark 之間的會議撰寫了會議記錄。這些是所做的筆記。

`Lisa and Mark discussed the recent database crash that happened last week. Lisa mentioned that after reviewing the logs, she realized the system overload might have been prevented if they had monitored the system load more closely. Mark agreed and added that the logs showed an unusually high number of queries hitting the database just before the crash. He suggested that if these queries had been spread more evenly, the system might not have failed.`

`Lisa also pointed out that they hadn't updated their database management software for some time. She believed that if the latest patches had been installed, some of the vulnerabilities exploited during the crash could have been fixed. Mark shared the same thought and expressed frustration that they had not prioritized the update earlier, which might have prevented the problem.`

`Finally, Lisa noted that although the situation was difficult, it was an important lesson. She asked how they could avoid such issues in the future, emphasizing the need for a more proactive maintenance strategy.`

在第一段中找到提到 Mark 和他的建議的零件。`Third Conditional` 中使用了一個結構，這表示所提到的事情實際上並未發生－它只是如果採取不同行動路線時可能的結果。透過閱讀這句話，你將能正確回答這個問題。
