What would the following code output?

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/i;
console.log(regex.test("I love FREECODECAMP!"));

console.log(regex.test("We went freeCodeCamping."));
```

## --answers--

true
true

---

When you want the match to start fresh with each new test.

### --feedback--

The `g` flag is stateful, meaning it tracks the last match, which can cause issues when testing multiple strings.

---

### --feedback--

The `m` modifier enables matching at the start and end of lines in multi-line strings.

---

It allows the regular expression to match linebreaks.

### --feedback--

The `m` modifier enables matching at the start and end of lines in multi-line strings.
