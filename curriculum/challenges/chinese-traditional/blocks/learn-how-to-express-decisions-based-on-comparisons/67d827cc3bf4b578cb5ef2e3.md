在他們對話後一個月，Brian 寄了一封電子郵件給 Sarah：  

`Hi Sarah,`  

`I hope you're doing well. I wanted to update you on our software development project.`  

`We decided to build the core parts in-house and outsource the rest. This has worked well. The in-house team has stronger control, while outsourcing has made things faster.`  

`There were some challenges. Communication with the external team was difficult at first, but regular check-ins helped. Our team also needed more support, so we reassigned some resources.`  

`Overall, this approach is more reliable than full outsourcing because we control key parts while saving time. However, we are still improving our process.`  

`Thanks again for your suggestion! Let's catch up soon.`  

`Best,`  

`Brian`

要找到正確答案，請考慮 Brian 如何描述團隊的通訊挑戰。注意 Brian 在 `Communication with the external team was difficult at first, but...` 之後所說的內容。

他表示通訊一開始很困難，但在團隊開始與外部團隊定期進行檢查後有所改善。
