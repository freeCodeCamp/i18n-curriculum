# --description--

我們用 `do` 詢問日常事務。

使用組助動詞 `do` 構成疑問句時，主要動詞應保持一般形式不變。 例如：

- Statement: `She works as a full-stack dev.`

- Question: `Does she work as a full-stack dev?`

Notice in the question above that `work` doesn't change to `works`, even when asking about a third person singular subject like `he`, `she`, or `it`.
