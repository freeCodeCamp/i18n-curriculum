Progressive enhancement is a design approach that ensures all users, regardless of browser or device, can access the essential content and functionality of an application.

It focuses on delivering a core experience that works for everyone, while offering extra features and improvements to users with more advanced browsers or better internet connections.

The progressive enhancement approach lives by these core principles:

- 所有核心内容和基本功能都应在所有浏览器上可访问
- 所有高级布局都应通过外部 CSS 样式表提供
- 所有高级功能都应通过外部 JavaScript 文件提供
- 应尊重用户的浏览器偏好设置

Using a progressive enhancement approach makes your applications more accessible because all core content and functionality should not be blocked in unsupported environments.

In terms of speed, a progressive enhancement approach can also help improve the performance of your applications.

Those users that are working with slower internet connection speeds will still be able to access the content because the browser will download the necessary resources first.

When it comes to SEO, progressive enhancement can also help improve the visibility of your applications.

Search engines will be able to crawl the content of your applications because the core content is available in the initial HTML response.

While some have criticized this approach deeming that it is not always realistic for applications that rely heavily on JavaScript for their functionality, it is still a good practice to follow when building applications.
