這是 Lisa 和 Bob 對話的摘要：

`Lisa is excited about the next hackathon. She plans to develop a new app for real-time project collaboration.`

`Her team includes a couple of developers from the Seattle branch and a UX designer she has worked with before. They are thinking of calling the app "CollabReal."`

`Usually, around fifty people join these events. Bob is interested and asks where he can find more information.`

`Lisa offers to help him sign up and asks when he is free to go over the form. Bob suggests meeting tomorrow during lunch, and Lisa agrees.`

這是真的還是假的：Lisa 計劃獨自開發新的應用程式。
