# --explanation--

`That's true` is often used to show agreement. 例如：

`That's true, we can proceed with the update.` - This means that you agree with something that was said earlier.

`Back-end stuff` is being used in a informal way to refer to the systems and services that support the visible part of a website or application, but are not seen by users.

`Stuff` alone is a general word used to refer to things, tasks, or activities. 例如：

`We need to fix the back-end stuff before the site can go live.` - This means the technical work related to the back end must be completed first.
