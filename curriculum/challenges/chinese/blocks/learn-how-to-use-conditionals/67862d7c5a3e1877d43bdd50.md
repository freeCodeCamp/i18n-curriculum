`Lisa: Hey Tom, have you ever thought about what would happen if TechCorp went out of business?`

`Tom: If TechCorp went out of business, it would be a big BLANK. They work with so many companies. Why do you ask?`

`Lisa: I read they might be having BLANK. If they closed, it would affect a lot of tech companies, wouldn't it?`
