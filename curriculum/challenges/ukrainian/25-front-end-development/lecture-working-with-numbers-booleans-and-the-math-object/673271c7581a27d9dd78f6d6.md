## --text--

Why is it a good idea to use strict equality (`===`) instead of regular equality (`==`) in JavaScript?

## --answers--

It converts data types automatically.

### --feedback--

Think about how strict equality handles data types compared to regular equality.

---

It allows you to compare different types without issues.

### --feedback--

Think about how strict equality handles data types compared to regular equality.

---

It checks both value and type, providing more predictable results.

---

It is faster than regular equality.

### --feedback--

Think about how strict equality handles data types compared to regular equality.

## --text--

What happens when you use regular equality (`==`) in JavaScript?

## --answers--

It only compares the values without any type conversion.

### --feedback--

Think about how JavaScript handles different types with regular equality.

---

It performs type coercion, converting values to the same type before comparing them.

---

It checks both value and type, like strict equality (`===`).

### --feedback--

Think about how JavaScript handles different types with regular equality.

---

It throws an error if the types donâ€™t match.

### --feedback--

Think about how JavaScript handles different types with regular equality.
