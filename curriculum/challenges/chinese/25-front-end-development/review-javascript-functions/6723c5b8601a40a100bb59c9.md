Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

## JavaScript Functions

- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- Functions can be defined using the `function` keyword followed by a name, a list of parameters, and a block of code that performs the task.
- Arguments are values passed to a function when it is called.
- When a function finishes its execution, it will always return a value.
- By default the return value of a function is `undefined`.
- The `return` keyword is used to specify the value to be returned from the function and ends the function execution.

## Arrow Functions

- Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript.
- Arrow functions are defined using the `=>` syntax between the parameters and the function body.
- When defining an arrow function, you do not need the `function` keyword.
- If you are using a single parameter, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter list.
- If the function body consists of a single expression, you can omit the curly braces and the `return` keyword.

## Scope in Programming

- **Global scope**: This is the outermost scope in JavaScript. Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the code and are called global variables.
- **Local scope**: This is refers to variables declared within a function. These variables are only accessible within the function where they are declared and are called local variables.
- **Block scope**: A block is a set of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}` such as in `if` statements, or loops.
- Block scoping with `let` and `const` provides even finer control over variable accessibility, helping to prevent errors and make your code more predictable.
