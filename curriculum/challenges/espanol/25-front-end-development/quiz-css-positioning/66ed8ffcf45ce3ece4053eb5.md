---

The sticky element will maintain its behavior regardless of scrolling.

---

The sticky element will act as if it has `position: fixed` within the parent.

#### --text--

How does a floated element impact the height of its containing block when the containing block does not have an explicit height defined?

#### --distractors--

The height of the containing block is automatically expanded to fit the floated element.

---

The height will automatically adapt to fit all the floated elements.

---

### --question--

#### --distractors--

It removes the element from the normal document flow, which affects the positions of siblings.

---

The relative element will move by the parent's top and left properties.

---

It creates a new stacking context which lifts the element in relation to any siblings.

#### --answer--

It allows the element to shift without affecting the document flow of sibling elements.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a `position: relative` element is nested inside of a `position: absolute` parent, with `top` and `left` values set?

#### --distractors--

It moves relative to the parent element's original position.

---

It moves with respect to the absolute coordinates of the containing parent element.

---

It will never create a new stacking context regardless of the `z-index` value.

#### --answer--

It ignores the positioning of the parent and moves relative to its normal position.

### --question--
