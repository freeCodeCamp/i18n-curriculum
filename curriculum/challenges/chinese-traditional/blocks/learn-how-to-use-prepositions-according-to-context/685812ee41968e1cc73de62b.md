在從 Sarah 那裡獲得幫助後，James 決定寫一份備忘錄，讓其他人能更輕鬆地找到設備。

`Hello team,`

`To make it easier for everyone setting up or upgrading their workstations, here's an updated overview of where you can find commonly used items:`

`- Monitors`

`Monitors have been moved. You'll find them along the corridor, just past the break area. Look to your left, near the coffee machine.`

`- Keyboards`

`After last week's shipment, all keyboards are now kept in a labeled storage room. It's located near the main entrance — take a right just before reaching it. It's the second door on your left, across from the mail room.`

`- Ethernet Cables & Accessories`

`These are stored in a smaller closet a bit out of the way. Head towards the server room, but turn right just before the door. The closet is on your right. It's a bit of a trek, but worth it if you need cables or extra accessories.`

`Please keep these areas organized for others. If you move any equipment, let IT know!`

`Best,`

`James`
