## --sentence--

`Maria: As we look at BLANK ahead, we need to distribute our resources carefully. All of our projects need some attention, but we can't cover everything at once.`

`James: I agree. How about we allocate half of our server capacity to the main project since it's crucial for our yearly goals? We could give the other half to support both of our smaller initiatives.`

`Maria: That sounds reasonable. But, none of the smaller projects should get advanced analytics tools yet. They're not ready for BLANK of integration. Maybe we could allocate another two developers to them instead, to help speed up the basic development.`

`James: I see your point, but we have no extra developers available until next month. It's BLANK. We can't hire anyone new right now, either. Perhaps we could slightly extend our current team's hours?`

`Maria: We might face BLANK there. Neither the developers nor the project managers want longer hours. It could lead to burnout. Why don't we consider using either part-time contractors or spreading tasks among existing projects?`

`James: That's a good option. Let's also ensure that any changes in BLANK are communicated clearly. We need to make sure no critical task is missed.`

`Maria: Exactly, James. I'll make BLANK for resource allocation and share it with you tomorrow. We can review it together and make changes before showing it to the whole team.`

`James: Perfect, Maria. Thanks for leading this. We'll meet again BLANK to finish everything.`
