# --explanation--

`Office furniture` includes desks, chairs, shelves, and other items needed for a workspace. Since many employees work from home, they may use the stipend to buy a good chair or a larger desk. 例如：

- `The company provided office furniture for remote employees.` - The company gave desks, chairs, or other work-related items to employees working from home.

- `The startup saved money by getting second-hand office furniture.` - The company bought used desks, chairs, or other items instead of new ones to cut costs.
