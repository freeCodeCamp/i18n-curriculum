`Tom: Ugh. I'm really trying to understand how to use this library but I'm BLANK. Mind if I ask you for some guidance?`

`Sarah: Of course. I'm here to help. What are you having BLANK?`

`Tom: Well, I'm trying to understand the basics, like how to set up the environment. Have you ever worked with this tech stack before?`

`Sarah: Yes, I have. Setting up the environment can be a bit tricky initially. Let's BLANK the steps together. First, download the installer from the official website. It'll guide you through the setup process.`

`Sarah: If you have BLANK during the installation, don't hesitate to reach out. We can BLANK together. By the way, have you ever tried looking at the official documentation for this library?`

`Tom: I looked at it but it seemed a bit overwhelming. Do you have any tips for how to BLANK it?`
