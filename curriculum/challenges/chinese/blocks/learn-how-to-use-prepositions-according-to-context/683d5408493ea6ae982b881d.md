Which sentence uses the word `near` correctly?

`The developer near fixed the bug this morning.`

### --feedback--

`Near` should not be used before a verb in this way.

This is not the correct structure. Use `almost` or another word, not `near`, in this context.

---

`The printer is near the manager's office.`

---

`She is near finishing the user guide.`

### --反馈--

The phrase should be `almost finished` or `close to finishing`, not `near finishing`.

# --explanation--

`Near` is used to describe physical closeness or short distance between objects or places.

In the correct sentence, it clearly shows the printer's position in relation to the manager's office. This is the intended and proper use of `near` as a preposition to describe location.
