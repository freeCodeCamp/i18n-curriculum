## --sentence--

`Sarah: Hey Mark, have you noticed that some computers aren't BLANK properly?`

`Mark: Yes, I have. If the BLANK isn't connected securely, the computer won't turn on. Did you check that?`

`Sarah: I did, but the problem seems to be more than just the power connection. Have you seen anything similar?`

`Mark: Sometimes if the BIOS is BLANK, it prevents the computer from starting. If that's the case, it can be tricky to fix.`

`Sarah: Yeah, it can. Speaking of which, another thing we can check is if the hard drive is failing. If it's not functioning, the BLANK won't load, will it?`

`Mark: Right, it won't. And if there's a BLANK, it can be because of incompatible drivers or outdated software. Have you updated the drivers recently?`

`Sarah: Not yet. I was thinking about updating them this week. What else could cause software to crash?`

`Mark: If the application has BLANK, it can lead to crashes. If you notice the system BLANK or freezing, that's a sign.`

`Sarah: Absolutely. Thanks for the insights, Mark.`
