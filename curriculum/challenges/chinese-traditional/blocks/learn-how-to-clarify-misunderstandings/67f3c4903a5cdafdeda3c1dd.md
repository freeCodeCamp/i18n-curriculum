## --sentence--

`Jessica: Hi, David. I wanted to check in about the latest mobile app update for the finance project. There seems to be some BLANK about the testing phase. Can we go over it?`

`David: Sure, Jessica. I thought the testing was complete, but when I looked at the report, it said there were still some issues. What's the story?`

`Jessica: I'm sorry for BLANK. We've completed the main testing, but we've found some minor bugs in the user interface. We're fixing them, but I get why the report might have been unclear.`

`David: Does that mean the app's launch will be delayed? I thought we were BLANK to release by the end of the week.`

`Jessica: Not necessarily. We're handling the bugs, but it shouldn't affect the launch schedule. Just to clarify, the core features are working fine, but there are a few glitches we're BLANK. Does that help?`

`David: That makes sense. I was worried we'd have to push back the launch date.`

`Jessica: No, we're still on schedule. Sorry for the miscommunication. If anything changes, I'll let you know right away. Is there anything else about the app you want to discuss?`

`David: Yeah, I noticed the budget tracking feature wasn't in the latest build. Was that BLANK to be in this update, or is it coming later?`

`Jessica: Oh, that might be a BLANK. The budget tracking feature is planned for the next update, not this one. Let me double-check and get back to you.`

`David: Thanks, Jessica. I'd appreciate it. I just want to make sure we're BLANK.`

`Jessica: Of course. I'll send you an updated project timeline later today so we're clear on what's coming up. Thanks for pointing that out.`

`David: No problem. Talk to you soon.`
