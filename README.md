# FreeCodeCamp Curriculum Translations

This repository holds the translations for freeCodeCamp's curriculum. It's designed to be used as a submodule of the main freeCodeCamp repo.

There are two actions,
One to download the curriculum files and create a PR to this repo with the new translations,
And another to merge that PR and create a PR to the freeCodeCamp repo that updates the submodule to the latest commit.
