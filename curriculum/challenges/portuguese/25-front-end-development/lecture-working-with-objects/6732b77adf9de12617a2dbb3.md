Remember what we said about the shorthand syntax when property names match variable names.

---

It creates an object with `null` values for `name` and `age`.

### --feedback--

Remember what we said about the shorthand syntax when property names match variable names.

It throws an error because it's invalid syntax.

### --feedback--
