## --sentence--

`Brian: Hey, how's it going? I noticed you're relatively new here. What's your BLANK in tech?`

`Sophie: Hey! Yeah, I joined the team a few months ago. I didn't study computer science at university, but I BLANK electrical engineering. It wasn't exactly tech-related, but I learned a lot about problem solving and critical thinking.`

`Brian: That's interesting. So you didn't work on many programming projects during your studies, did you?`

`Sophie: No, not really. I BLANK with coding, but most of my projects involved circuit designs and electrical systems. It was a bit different.`

`Brian: I see. Did you enjoy your time there, even if it wasn't entirely tech-focused?`

`Sophie: I did. It was challenging, but I met some fantastic people. We had a bunch of fun BLANK, although I wasn't always a very strong programmer.`

`Brian: Well, we all have different journeys. I studied at a small college as well and majored in information technology. It was more BLANK, and I loved every bit of it. We didn't have to wear too many hats, but I got to build and maintain networks and manage a few small projects.`

`Sophie: That sounds cool. Did you ever work on any big projects during your BLANK?`

`Brian: They weren't exactly big projects. Most of them were smaller scale, but it was a great BLANK. It's fascinating to me how we all take different paths but end up in the same tech world, right?`

`Sophie: Absolutely. Let's grab a coffee sometime and chat more.`
