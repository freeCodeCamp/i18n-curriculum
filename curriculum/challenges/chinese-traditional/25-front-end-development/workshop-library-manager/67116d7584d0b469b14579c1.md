# --description--

The rest of the objects representing the books have been filled in for you. You can take a look at them.

Now, you should start working on getting several common parts of the books.

Start by displaying all the books. Create a `displayBooks` function with a `catalog` parameter. The function should return a string that contains the `title`, `author`, and `pages` of all the books in the `library` array.

# --hints--

You should create a `displayBooks` function.

```js
assert.isFunction(displayBooks)
```

Your `displayBooks` function should have a `catalog` parameter.

```js
assert.match(displayBooks.toString(), /catalog/)
```

Your `displayBooks` function should use a higher order function. Ex. (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`)

```js
assert.match(displayBooks.toString(), /filter|map|reduce|forEach/);
```

Your `displayBooks` function should return a string.

```js
assert.isString(displayBooks(library))
```

Your `displayBooks` function should have each book title, author and pages in it.

```js
library.forEach((book) => {
  assert.include(displayBooks(library), book.title);
  assert.include(displayBooks(library), book.author);
  assert.include(displayBooks(library), book.pages.toString());
});
```

Your `displayBooks` function should contain the total of `8` books avaialble in the library.

```js
function getNumOfBooks(catalog) {
  return catalog.map(book => `${book.title} by ${book.author}`);
}

assert.lengthOf(getNumOfBooks(library), 8);
```
