Learning is a skill all its own. And I'm going to quickly introduce you to key observations that scientists have made about learning.

以下观点来自于工程学家 Barbara Oakley 撰写的书籍 *《学习如何学习》*。

Concept number 1: spaced repetition. Learning for half an hour each day for a week is much more effective than learning for three and a half hours all in one day. This is because of the role that sleep plays in memory. When you sleep, your brain builds and reinforces neural structures. With spaced repetition, you review concepts regularly — first every few days, then every few weeks, then every few months. Each time, your retention of those concepts improves. freeCodeCamp has spaced repetition baked right into the curriculum.

Concept number 2: interleaving practice. Rather than just studying one concept for an entire study session, it's better to get a little exposure to lots of concepts. This shakes up your brain, and forces you to continually reframe what you know. Through interleaving practice, you train yourself to be more agile in your thinking. For this reason, the freeCodeCamp curriculum covers a ton of ground quickly, then circles back to reinforce everything over and over.

Concept number 3: active recall. It's easy to trick yourself into thinking you're much better at a skill than you actually are. Almost all beginners experience what scientists call an "illusion of competence". But, the best way to shatter that illusion is to actively recall and apply what you're learning. The freeCodeCamp curriculum does this through quizzes, coding exercises, and full-blown projects.

Again, we've incorporated all of these concepts into the freeCodeCamp curriculum. You're welcome to customize your learning as you see fit. But when in doubt, just keep going through the curriculum, from top to bottom, and you'll be fine.

在下一讲中，我们将讨论培养有效学习习惯的一些策略。
