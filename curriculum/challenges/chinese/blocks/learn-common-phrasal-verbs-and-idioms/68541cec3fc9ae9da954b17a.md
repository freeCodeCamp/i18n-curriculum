## --sentence--

`Anna: Brian, we really need to BLANK the updates to our remote work policy. There's been a lot of back and forth on what should be included.`

`Brian: Right, and while we're at it, let's wrap up the section on professional development. We should encourage staff to branch out in their skills without making it sound too daunting.`

`Anna: Great idea, Brian. Encouraging growth is key. How about we put together a draft of these changes and BLANK the team leads before we BLANK company-wide?`

`Brian: Sounds like a plan. I'll draft up the changes and BLANK a meeting with the team leads next week. We can iron out any kinks, then get everyone's buy-in.`

`Anna: Perfect, Brian. Thanks for helping to make these policies clearer. It's important that they reflect our company's values and current work environment.`

`Brian: My pleasure, Anna. Let's make sure these policies do just that.`
