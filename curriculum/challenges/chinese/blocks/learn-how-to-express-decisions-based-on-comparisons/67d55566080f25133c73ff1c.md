在和 Tom 交谈后，Alice 给她妈妈发送了一条文本消息：

`Hey Mom, I've decided to switch jobs! I want to find a company with the best work-life balance and good career growth opportunities. I talked to my friend Tom, and he gave me a lot to think about. He told me about a few companies. One has the most structured training programs, another offers the highest salaries, and one has the most laid-back culture. That's interesting because I never thought so much about these differences before.`

`I think I'd really enjoy working in a place with a creative and relaxed environment. I also want a job that lets me grow but still gives me time for myself. Good to know there are companies that offer both!`

`Mom, I really appreciate that you always support me. I'll keep you updated! 😊💕`

# --explanation--

Alice 通过说 `Mom, I really appreciate that you always support me.` 来表达感谢。

`Appreciate` 意味着感激。

她不会抱怨找工作，不会拒绝建议，也不会说她不再需要帮助。相反，她承认妈妈的帮助，并承诺会随时向她汇报情况。
