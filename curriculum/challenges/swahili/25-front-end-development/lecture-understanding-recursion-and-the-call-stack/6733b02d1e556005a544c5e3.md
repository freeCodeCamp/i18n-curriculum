# --description--

Watch the video lecture and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the primary purpose of a base case in a recursive function?

## --answers--

To initiate the recursive calls.

### --feedback--

The lecture mentions what happens if you don't have a base case established.

---

To prevent infinite recursion and stack overflow.

---

To improve performance of the function.

### --feedback--

The lecture mentions what happens if you don't have a base case established.

---

To handle error conditions.

### --feedback--

The lecture mentions what happens if you don't have a base case established.

## --text--

In the context of recursion, what is the call stack used for?

## --answers--

To store local variables.

### --feedback--

The lecture explains how the call stack manages function calls during recursion.

---

To track and resolve function calls.

---

To optimize recursive functions.

### --feedback--

The lecture explains how the call stack manages function calls during recursion.

---

To handle asynchronous operations.

### --feedback--

The lecture explains how the call stack manages function calls during recursion.

## --text--

What happens when a recursive function call reaches its base case?

## --answers--

It starts a new recursive cycle.

### --feedback--

Think about how the function behaves when it hits the condition that stops the recursion.

---

It throws an error.

### --feedback--

Think about how the function behaves when it hits the condition that stops the recursion.

---

It returns and allows the previous call to resume execution.

---

It continues to call itself indefinitely.

### --feedback--

Think about how the function behaves when it hits the condition that stops the recursion.
