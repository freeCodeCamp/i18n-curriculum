## --sentence--

`Bob: Hi, Maria. I heard there was some BLANK in the last team meeting. Can we talk about it?`  

`Maria: Sure, Bob. It's about the new deadline. The team is really worried it's too tight. They're feeling quite BLANK with the extra workload.`  

`Bob: I see. Did they mention why they think it's too tight?`  

`Maria: Yes, they said they're already putting in extra hours. If we add more tasks, it could lead to burnout.`  

`Bob: So, did they say how we could fix it?`  

`Maria: They mentioned a couple of things. First, they really need more support. We're quite BLANK a few roles, which makes it hard to meet the new deadline.`  

`Bob: Okay, is there anything else we should consider?`  

`Maria: They also said the communication isn't great. Because they often don't hear about changes until it's too late. It'd be helpful if we had more regular check-ins.`  

`Bob: That makes sense. Could you set up a weekly meeting to discuss progress and keep everyone BLANK? It might help reduce stress and avoid BLANK.`  

`Maria: Sure, I can do that. But to really BLANK, we might need to adjust the deadline, even if it's just a few days. This would give the team some BLANK.`  

`Bob: I'll look into it. Could you also find out how much extra time they really need?`  

`Maria: Sure, I'll talk to the team and let you know what they say. Let's also plan a meeting to discuss resources with HR.`
