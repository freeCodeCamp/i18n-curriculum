在创建了团队现有内容的总结后，Sophie 建议了进一步的需求：

`Subject: Inventory Check. Let's Plan for What We Need`

`Hi team,`

`I've reviewed our current software tools and wanted to share a quick update, along with a few things we might need to plan for:`

- `Licenses: We have 50 total (30 used by the design team). They're saved in the central server's "Licensed Software" folder and the "Backup Licenses" section in the cloud. We may need extra licenses soon if more team members join or switch tools.`

- `Graphic Tablets: We currently have 15 (10 in the storage room, 5 in the workshop). It might be helpful to have 1-2 extra tablets as backups, in case of damage or increased use.`

- `Design Software: Updates are still pending for 5 main tools. These should be installed by next week. Last month, the team used the platform around 60 hours a week, peaking at 80. If this usage continues to grow, we might need to check if the tools are running smoothly or need upgrades.`

`Please let me know if you've noticed any shortages or if there's anything specific your team needs soon. I'll use your feedback to prepare our next steps.`

`Best,`

`Sophie`
