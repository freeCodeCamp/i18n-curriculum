`Did BLANK else come up while you were debugging?`

## --blanks--

`anything`

### --feedback--

This word is used in questions to ask if something occurred or existed.

# --explanation--

`Anything` is used in questions to ask if something happened, existed, or was present. It is neutral and does not assume the existence of anything specific. 例如：

`Did anything unusual happen during the test?` - Meaning you are asking about unusual events that could be found during the test.

In affirmative sentences, use `something` to indicate the existence of a thing. 例如：

`Something interesting happened during the meeting.` - Meaning a different thing than the usual happened.

In negative sentences, use `anything` to indicate that no thing occurred or existed. 例如：

`I didn't see anything unusual in the report.` - meaning there were no surprises in the report.
