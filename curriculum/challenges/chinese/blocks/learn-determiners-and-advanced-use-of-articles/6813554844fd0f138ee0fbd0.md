## --sentence--

`Bob: As we start the new mobile app project, we need to decide who will do what. Each developer will have BLANK.`

`Alice: That's a great idea. We have BLANK to work on, and our developers have different skills. How are we going to assign these tasks?`

`Bob: We'll match tasks to each developer's skills. Sarah will take care of user authentication because she has the most experience there. Tom will work on payment integration.`

`Alice: What about those new developers we started onboarding BLANK ago?`

`Bob: Each new developer will work with someone more experienced. This way, every new person gets help, and no one feels too stressed.`

`Alice: That makes sense. Do we have BLANK for how often we'll check their progress?`

`Bob: Yes. We'll meet every two weeks to talk about how everyone is doing and to solve any problems. It's important that no part of the project gets delayed.`

`Alice: I'm not sure we have enough QA people to test all the new features, though.`

`Bob: Agreed. We're a little short on testers right now. I'm considering bringing in a couple more people for BLANK. I'll talk to HR and see if we can get some more help.`

`Alice: That would be great! Proper testing is crucial, especially for the more complex parts of the app.`

`Bob: Definitely. I'll make sure we have all the resources we need. Let's make sure everyone knows their responsibilities by the end of BLANK.`

`Alice: I'll get started on a list of technical requirements for BLANK of the project to help us assign tasks correctly.`
