<!-- (Audio) Candidate: We were involved in the development of an e-commerce platform. We were responsible for the checkout process, and it was a successful implementation. -->

# --description--

正如之前回顾的，`Past Simple` 时态用于表示过去完成的动作。

在这个上下文中，`we were involved in` 结合了 `Past Simple` 时态（`were`）和表达式 `involved in`，意思是成为某事的一部分，尤其是在积极或重要的角色中。例如：

`They were involved in organizing the event。` - 这意味着他们在组织该事件中发挥了重要作用。
