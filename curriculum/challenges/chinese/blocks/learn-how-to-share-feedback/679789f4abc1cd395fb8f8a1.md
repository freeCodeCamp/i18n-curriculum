# --explanation--

`Making changes` means modifying or improving something to make it better or more effective. 例如：

`The company is making changes to its policies to improve employee satisfaction.` - This means the company is adjusting its policies to achieve better outcomes.

In this context, Jessica is likely referring to improving the documentation.
