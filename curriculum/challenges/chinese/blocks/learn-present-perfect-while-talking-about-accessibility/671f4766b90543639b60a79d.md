# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect Continuous` tense negative form is formed with `hasn't/haven't + been + present participle`, indicating an ongoing action that hasn't occurred as expected over time. 例如：

`He hasn't been exercising regularly.` - This means his exercise routine has been irregular.

The `Present Perfect` tense negative form uses `hasn't/haven't + past participle`, describing an action that has not been completed up to the present moment. 例如：

`He hasn't exercised this week.` - This indicates no exercise occurred this week.
