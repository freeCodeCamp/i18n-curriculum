# --explanation--

Modal verb is always followed by the base form of the verb. Modal verb does not take `to`, `-ing`, or past tense forms. Here are examples of the incorrect verb forms:

- `Must to follow` is incorrect because `must` takes `to`.

- `Must following` is incorrect because `must` is followed by an `-ing` form.

- `Must followed` is incorrect because `followed` is in the past tense.
