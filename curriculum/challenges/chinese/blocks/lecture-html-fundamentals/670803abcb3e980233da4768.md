The `div` element is used as a container to group other elements.

Here is an example of a `div` element. Add another paragraph element inside of the `div` element and see the changes in the preview window.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<div>
  <p>Example paragraph element.</p>

</div>
```

:::

You will mainly use the `div` element when you want to group HTML elements that will share a set of CSS styles. You will learn more about CSS in future lessons and workshops.

Even though the `div` element is commonly used in real world codebases, you should be careful not to overuse it. There are times when another element would be more appropriate.

For example, if you wanted divide up your content into sections, then the `section` element would be more appropriate than a `div` element.

Add another `section` element below the first one. Then inside of the `section` element, a `h2` and `p` elements. You can use whatever text you like and you will see the changes in the preview window.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<section>
  <h2>Mammals</h2>
  <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair. Most give birth to live young.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lion</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Dolphin</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

:::

The `section` element has semantic meaning over the `div` element which is not semantic. 语义是语言中单词或短语的含义。 HTML 是一种语言，元素也有自己的语义含义。 因此，这意味着如果你使用了 `section` 元素， 浏览器将获取其语义含义并理解应将其视为一个独立部分——无论是在台式机上、移动设备上，还是其他任何设备上。
