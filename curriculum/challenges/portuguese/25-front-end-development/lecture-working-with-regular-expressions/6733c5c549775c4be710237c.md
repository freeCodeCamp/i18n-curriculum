## --text--

What is the main difference between `match()` and `matchAll()` methods when used with a global regular expression?

## --answers--

`match()` returns an array, while `matchAll()` returns an Iterator.

---

`matchAll()` is faster than `match()`.

### --feedback--

The lecture describes a special type of object returned by `matchAll()`.

---

`match()` can only find the first occurrence, while `matchAll()` finds all occurrences.

### --feedback--

The lecture describes a special type of object returned by `matchAll()`.

---

There is no difference, they are interchangeable

### --feedback--

The lecture describes a special type of object returned by `matchAll()`.

## --text--

How can you convert the result of `matchAll()` into an array containing all matches?

## --answers--

By using a `for...of` loop

### --feedback--

The lecture demonstrates a specific method to convert the `Iterator` to an array.

---

By calling the `toArray()` method on the result.

### --feedback--

The lecture demonstrates a specific method to convert the `Iterator` to an array.

---

By using `Array.from()` with the result as an argument.

---

By spreading the result into an array literal.
