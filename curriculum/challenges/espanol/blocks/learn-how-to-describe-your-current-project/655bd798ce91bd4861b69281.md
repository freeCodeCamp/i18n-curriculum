<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I'm looking at customer data to find patterns. We're trying to understand what our customers like and what they buy, but we're not having any luck at the moment. -->

# --description--

`Present Continuous` tense is used for actions happening at the moment of speaking. For example, `We're being successful with our marketing campaign`. Notice how the verb `to be` was conjugated as `being` to demonstrate that this is true at the present moment.

`Present Continuous` can be used in negative forms to express that something is not happening. For example:

- `I'm not working today.` - Here, the speaker explains that working is not happening.

- `They're not finding any solutions.` - This shows that the action of finding solutions is not taking place.
