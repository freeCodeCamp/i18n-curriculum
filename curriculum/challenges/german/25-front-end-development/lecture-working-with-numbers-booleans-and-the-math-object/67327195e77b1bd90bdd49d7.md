# --description--

Watch the lecture video and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What happens when you run the following code?

```js
const result = 3 + "19";
```

## --answers--

JavaScript ignores the string and only performs the operation on the number.

### --feedback--

Recall how type coercion works for addition operations, and how you use the same symbol to combine strings.

---

JavaScript throws an error when you try to mix strings and numbers in arithmetic.

### --feedback--

Recall how type coercion works for addition operations, and how you use the same symbol to combine strings.

---

JavaScript converts the number `3` into the string `"3"`, concatenates the two strings, and assigns the value `"319"` to `result`.

---

JavaScript converts the string `"19"` into the number `19`, performs the operation, and assigns the value `22` to `result`.

## --text--

What happens when you run the following code?

```js
const result = "6" - 4;
```

## --answers--

Conversion fails and JavaScript returns `NaN`.

### --feedback--

Recall how type coercion works for subtraction, multiplication, division, and other kinds of operations.

---

JavaScript converts the number `4` into the string `"4"`, concatenates the two strings, and assigns the value `"64"` to `result`.

### --feedback--

Recall how type coercion works for subtraction, multiplication, division, and other kinds of operations.

---

The value `Infinity` is assigned to `result`.

### --feedback--

Recall how type coercion works for subtraction, multiplication, division, and other kinds of operations.

---

JavaScript converts the string `"6"` into the number `6`, performs the operation, and assigns the value `2` to `result`.

## --text--

What happens when you perform arithmetic operations with a boolean (`true` or `false`) in JavaScript?

## --answers--

JavaScript throws an error.

### --feedback--

Consider how JavaScript interprets `true` and `false` in numerical contexts.

---

JavaScript ignores the boolean and only performs the operation on numbers.

### --feedback--

Consider how JavaScript interprets `true` and `false` in numerical contexts.

---

JavaScript treats `true` as `1` and `false` as `0` in arithmetic operations.

---

JavaScript converts the boolean to a string before performing the operation.

### --feedback--

Consider how JavaScript interprets `true` and `false` in numerical contexts.
