在和 Tom 談話後，Alice 傳送了一則文字訊息給她的媽媽：

`Hey Mom, I've decided to switch jobs! I want to find a company with the best work-life balance and good career growth opportunities. I talked to my friend Tom, and he gave me a lot to think about. He told me about a few companies. One has the most structured training programs, another offers the highest salaries, and one has the most laid-back culture. That's interesting because I never thought so much about these differences before.`

`I think I'd really enjoy working in a place with a creative and relaxed environment. I also want a job that lets me grow but still gives me time for myself. Good to know there are companies that offer both!`

`Mom, I really appreciate that you always support me. I'll keep you updated! 😊💕`

# --explanation--

Tom 幫助 Alice 解釋不同公司如何提供不同的利益。他提到有一家公司有 `the most structured training`，另一家有 `the highest salaries`，還有一家有 `the most laid-back culture`。

這表示他幫助她比較選項，而不是暗示所有公司都一樣或建議她留在目前的工作。
