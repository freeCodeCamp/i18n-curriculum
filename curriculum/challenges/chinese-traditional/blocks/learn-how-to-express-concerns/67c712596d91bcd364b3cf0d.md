聽音頻，回答下面的問題。

# --questions--

## --text--

詹姆斯怎樣才能同意和瑪麗亞討論這個話題，同時詢問鮑勃說了什麼呢？

## --answers--

`Sure, Maria. What did he say about it?`

---

`Yes, but let's discuss it later.`

### --feedback--

This delays the conversation instead of agreeing and asking for details.

# --explanation--

James's question uses the `Simple Past` tense (in this case, `did he say`) because Maria's conversation with Bob is already finished. The `Simple Past` is used to ask about completed actions. Other examples:

- `What did she decide after the meeting?` - The question is about a meeting that is over.

- `Where did they go for lunch?` - The action of going somewhere has already happened. Lunchtime is finished.
