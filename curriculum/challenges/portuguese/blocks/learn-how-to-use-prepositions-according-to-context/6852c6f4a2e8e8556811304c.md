Bob enviou este e-mail para Anna após a discussão deles:

`Hi Anna,`

`Thanks again for your input earlier. I've updated the layout draft based on our discussion. Below is a summary of the current plan, along with a couple of suggestions for next steps.`

`- IT department: located next to the server room in the back, behind the emergency exit. This ensures quick access for technical needs.`

`- HR department: assigned the space across from the reception area, near the entrance. This spot should make it easier for visitors and new employees to find HR quickly.`

`- Marketing team: positioned on the left side of the building, next to the sales office. It's a bit isolated from the main walkways, which should help keep their area quiet.`

`- Customer support: placed behind the conference rooms, in a central area in the middle of the floor. This keeps them easily reachable by all teams.`

`- Break room: arranged between IT and HR. It's a convenient spot that provides a short walk for most teams and keeps the space equally accessible.`

`We may want to confirm these placements with each team lead to make sure they're comfortable with the setup.`

`Once confirmed, we can send out the final layout and timeline to all staff.`

`We could also consider adding signs at key points like the entrance, hallway, and lobby to help people find their departments during the first week.`

`Let me know if you'd like to discuss any tweaks. Otherwise, I'll move forward with sharing the final plan with everyone tomorrow.`

`Best,`

`Bob`

Bob sugere adicionar placas `at key points like the entrance, hallway, and lobby` para ajudar as pessoas a `find their departments during the first week`. Isso é claramente para melhorar a navegação.
