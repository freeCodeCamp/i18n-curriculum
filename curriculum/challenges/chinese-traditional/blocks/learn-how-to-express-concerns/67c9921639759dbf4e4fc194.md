## --sentence--

`Maria: Hey, James. Can we talk about my latest meeting with Bob? I need to understand how the team feels about the new project deadline.`

`James: Sure, Maria. What did he say about it?`

`Maria: Bob mentioned that the client wants us to finish the project a week BLANK. How do you think they will feel about that?`

`James: Honestly, they're BLANK stressed. We've already been putting in extra hours, and this new deadline isn't helping. It's like there's always more to do.`

`Maria: I hear you. This extra BLANK could lead to burnout. Wouldn't it be better if we prioritized the tasks differently to reduce stress?`

`James: That might help, but we also need more BLANK. We're short on a few key roles, and it's making things difficult for everyone.`

`Maria: I understand. I've talked to Bob about this, but I don't think it's an option. I'll bring it up again and see if I can BLANK him. Besides that, are there other issues I should know about?`

`James: Yes, communication has been a challenge. Sometimes we get updates too late, and it affects our work. It'd be great if we had more regular BLANK.`

`Maria: That's a good point. I'll suggest having more regular check-ins with the team to improve communication. Would that help?`

`James: Yes, that would be great. Thanks for listening, Maria.`

`Maria: No problem, James. I'll take this feedback to Bob. Let's work together to find a way to manage the stress.`
