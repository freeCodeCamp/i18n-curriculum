在和 Tom 交谈后，Alice 给她妈妈发送了一条文本消息：

`Hey Mom, I've decided to switch jobs! I want to find a company with the best work-life balance and good career growth opportunities. I talked to my friend Tom, and he gave me a lot to think about. He told me about a few companies. One has the most structured training programs, another offers the highest salaries, and one has the most laid-back culture. That's interesting because I never thought so much about these differences before.`

`I think I'd really enjoy working in a place with a creative and relaxed environment. I also want a job that lets me grow but still gives me time for myself. Good to know there are companies that offer both!`

`Mom, I really appreciate that you always support me. I'll keep you updated! 😊💕`

汤姆通过解释不同公司提供不同的福利来帮助爱丽丝。他提到一家公司的 `the most structured training`，另一家公司的 `the highest salaries`，还有一家公司的 `the most laid-back culture`。

这表明他帮助她比较选项，而不是暗示所有公司都一样或建议她留在当前的工作。
