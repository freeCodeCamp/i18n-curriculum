# --description--

Watch the lecture video and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What do unary operators do?

## --answers--

They act on two operands to perform arithmetic operations.

### --feedback--

Think about operators that require only one value.

---

They act on a single operand to perform tasks like type conversion, value manipulation, or condition checking.

---

They compare two values for equality.

### --feedback--

Think about operators that require only one value.

---

They only perform arithmetic operations.

### --feedback--

Think about operators that require only one value.

## --text--

What does the `typeof` operator do?

## --answers--

It converts a value to a string.

### --feedback--

Think about how to check the type of a variable.

---

It returns the type of its operand as a `string`.

---

It checks if two values are equal.

### --feedback--

Think about how to check the type of a variable.

---

It compares two variables for type coercion.

### --feedback--

Think about how to check the type of a variable.

## --text--

How does the bitwise `NOT` operator work in JavaScript?

## --answers--

It multiplies the value by `2`.

### --feedback--

Consider how the operator alters the binary representation of a value.

---

It adds `1` to the value.

### --feedback--

Consider how the operator alters the binary representation of a value.

---

It flips every bit, turning all `1`'s to `0`'s and all `0`'s to `1`'s.

---

It checks if the value is positive or negative.

### --feedback--

Consider how the operator alters the binary representation of a value.
