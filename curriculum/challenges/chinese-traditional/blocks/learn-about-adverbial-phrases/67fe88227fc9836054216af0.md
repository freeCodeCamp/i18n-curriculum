# --explanation--

`Biweekly` means occurring either once every two weeks or twice a week. It can, thus, describe something that happens twice a week (Bob's idea) or twice a month. 例如：

- `The team holds a biweekly meeting to discuss progress.` – This means the meeting occurs twice a week (or once every two weeks, depending on the speaker's intention).

- `We receive biweekly updates on the project's status.` – This means updates are given twice a week (or once every two weeks, again depending on the speaker's intention).
