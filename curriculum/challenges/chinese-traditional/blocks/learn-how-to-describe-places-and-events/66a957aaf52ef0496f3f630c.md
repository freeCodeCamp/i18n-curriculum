# --explanation--

In business, the word `branch` refers to a local office or division of a larger organization. 例如：

- `The company has a branch in Seattle.` - The company has a smaller office or location in Seattle, separate from the main office.

`Headquarters` refers to the main office or central hub of an organization. 例如：

- `The company's headquarters is in New York.` - This means the central office, where top management works, is located in New York.

In this task, pay attention to the difference between `branch` and `headquarters` to help you answer where Lisa likely meets with top management.
