What does the `modulus` assignment operator (`%=`) do in JavaScript?

## --answers--

Divides a variable by the specified number and assigns the quotient to the variable.

### --feedback--

Think about how the `modulus` operator works in a normal arithmetic operation.

---

Multiplies a variable by the specified number and assigns the product to the variable.

### --feedback--

What happens when you run the code `let points = 5; points *= 3;`?

## --answers--

`points` is multiplied by `3`, and the result is added to the original value of `points`.

### --feedback--

Think about how the `*=` compound assignment operator works.

---

`points` is divided by `3`.

### --feedback--

Think about how the `*=` compound assignment operator works.

---

`points` is multiplied by `3`, and the result (`15`) is assigned back to `points`.

---

`points` remains unchanged.

### --feedback--
