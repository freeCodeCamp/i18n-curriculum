## Importance of Semantic HTML

- **Structural hierarchy for heading elements**: It is important to use the correct heading element to maintain the structural hierarchy of the content. The `h1` element is the highest level of heading and the `h6` element is the lowest level of heading.
- **Presentational HTML elements**: Elements that define the appearance of content. Ex. the deprecated `center`, `big` and `font` elements.
- **Semantic HTML elements**: Elements that hold meaning and structure. Ex. `header`, `nav`, `figure`.
