# FreeCodeCamp Curriculum Translations

This repository holds the translations for freeCodeCamp's curriculum. It's designed to be used as a submodule of the main freeCodeCamp repo.

The "Download i18n Curriculum" and "Merge curriculum updates and update i18n-curriculum submodule" actions run automically. They download the curriculum from crowdin, make a PR to this repo with the updates, merge the PR, and then create a PR to the freeCodeCamp repo to update the submodule.

You can also run the [Update i18n-curriculum submodule action](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/i18n-curriculum/actions/workflows/update-submodule.yml) manually to update the freeCodeCamp repo to the latest version of this submodule.
