# --explanation--

Remember:

`May` expresses possibility or permission. 例如：

`May I use your phone?`

`Might` indicates a smaller possibility than `may`, often used for less certain situations. 例如：

`She might come to the meeting.`

`Can` expresses ability or permission. 例如：

`Can I leave early?`

`Could` is used for past ability, polite requests, or a less certain possibility than `can`. 例如：

`Could you help me?`
