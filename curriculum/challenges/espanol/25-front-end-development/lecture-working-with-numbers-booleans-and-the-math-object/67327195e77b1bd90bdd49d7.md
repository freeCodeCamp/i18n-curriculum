# --questions--

## --text--

What happens when you perform arithmetic operations with a boolean (`true` or `false`) in JavaScript?

## --answers--

JavaScript throws an error.

### --feedback--

Consider how JavaScript interprets `true` and `false` in numerical contexts.

---

JavaScript ignores the boolean and only performs the operation on numbers.

### --feedback--

Consider how JavaScript interprets `true` and `false` in numerical contexts.

---

JavaScript treats `true` as `1` and `false` as `0` in arithmetic operations.

---

JavaScript converts the boolean to a string before performing the operation.

### --feedback--

## --text--

What happens when you perform arithmetic operations like subtraction, multiplication, or division with a string and a number in JavaScript?

## --answers--

JavaScript ignores the string and only performs the operation on the number.

### --feedback--

Think about how JavaScript handles different data types in math operations.

---

JavaScript throws an error when you try to mix strings and numbers in arithmetic.

### --feedback--

Think about how JavaScript handles different data types in math operations.

---

JavaScript converts the string into a number before performing the operation, a process called type coercion.

---

JavaScript converts the number into a string before performing the operation.

## --text--

How does JavaScript handle arrays or objects in arithmetic operations?

## --answers--

It throws an error.

### --feedback--

Consider how JavaScript treats non-numeric types when combined with numbers.

---

It performs the arithmetic operation normally without any conversion.

### --feedback--

Consider how JavaScript treats non-numeric types when combined with numbers.

---

It converts the array or object to a string and then concatenates it with the number.

---

It ignores the array or object and only operates on the number.
