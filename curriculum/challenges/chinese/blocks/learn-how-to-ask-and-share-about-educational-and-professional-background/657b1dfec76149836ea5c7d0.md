<!-- (Audio) Sophie: It wasn't exactly tech-related, but I learned a lot about problem solving and critical thinking. -->

# --description--

你不能用 `didn't` 和某些动词构成过去时的否定。一个例子是动词 `to be`。

如果你想用过去时的动词 `to be` 创建否定句，只需在 `was` 或 `were` 后添加 `not`。例如：

| Affirmative | Negative |
| --- | --- |
| `It was working normally.` | `It wasn't working normally.` |
| `They were informed earlier.` | `They weren't informed earlier.` |

`Wasn't` 是 `was not` 的缩写，`weren't` 是 `were not` 的缩写。
