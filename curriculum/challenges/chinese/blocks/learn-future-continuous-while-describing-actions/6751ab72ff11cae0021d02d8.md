`Server` refers to a powerful computer or system that provides services, data, or resources to other devices, often over a network. 例如：

`The server hosts the company's website.` - This means the server is responsible for storing and delivering the website's content to users who access it.

`Load` refers to the amount of work, demand, or stress placed on a system or resource. 例如：

`The system crashed because it couldn't handle the high load during peak hours.` - This means the system became overwhelmed due to the large amount of demand placed on it.
