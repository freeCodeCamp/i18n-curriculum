```

#### --answer--

```

### --question--

#### --text--

Which `RegExp` contains the same pattern as the regular expression `/f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r/i`?

#### --distractors--

```js
new RegExp("/f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r/", "i")
```

---

```js

```js
new RegExp("f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r")
```

#### --answer--

```js
new RegExp("f[o0]{2} b[a4@]r", "i")
```

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the return type for the regular expression method `test`?

#### --distractors--

An array of strings that matched the regular expression.

---

An object containing information about the (sub)string the regular expression matched.

---

Null, the method `test` only validates if the given regular expression is valid.

#### --answer--

A boolean indicating whether the string matches the regular expression.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when `match` is used?

#### --distractors--

`match` searches for any strings that match the given regular expression, and returns ALL matches as an array.

---

`match` searches for the first full match, and returns the starting index of that match.

---

`match` searches for the first full match, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not a match was found.

#### --answer--

`match` searches for the first full match, and returns an array containing that first match.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which is the best use case for `test`?

#### --distractors--

`test` should be used for verifying a given regular expression.

---

`test` should be used for detailed information about a string match, such as the length of the matched string.

---

`test` should be used to extract all matches from a given string.

#### --answer--

`test` should be used to check if a given string matches the regular expression.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the purpose of using `replace`?

#### --distractors--

`replace` is used to replace the current regular expression with a new regular expression.

---

When given an index and a string, `replace` replaces the character at the specified index with the string provided.

---

`replace` is a helper method for replacing an entire string with another string.

#### --answer--

`replace` replaces a matched string with a given replacement string.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the difference between `match` and `matchAll`?

#### --distractors--

`match` is restricted to only one match, while `matchAll` captures all possible matches.

---

`match` returns a boolean indicating whether a match is found, while `matchAll` returns a number representing the amount of matches found.

---

`match` returns a number indicating the starting index of the first match found, while `matchAll` returns an array of numbers containing indices where a match was found.

#### --answer--

`match` returns an array of strings that match, while `matchAll` returns an iterator object of all matches found.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is the correct use of `replaceAll`?

#### --distractors--

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/, "fizzbuzz")
```

---

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/i, "fizzbuzz")
```

---

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/gi, /fizzbuzz/)
```

#### --answer--

```js
foo.replaceAll(/foobar/g, "fizzbuzz")
```

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following character classes is equivalent to the regular expression `/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/`?

---

`\s`

---

#### --answer--

`\w`

### --question--

#### --distractors--

`\w`

---

`\s`

---

`\D`

#### --answer--

`\d`

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a lookahead `(?=)` is used in a regular expression?

#### --distractors--

The lookahead will assert to the left of the string, verifying that the sub-pattern IS present.

---

A lookahead is an alternate regular expression pattern used when the main pattern fails to match.

---

The lookahead will assert to the right of the string, verifying that the sub-pattern IS NOT present.

#### --answer--

A lookahead asserts to the right of the string, verifying that the sub-pattern IS present.

### --question--

#### --text--

When making a regular expression, where should a lookbehind `(?<=)` be placed?

#### --distractors--

The lookbehind can be placed anywhere in the regular expression.

---

The lookbehind should be placed to the right of the main pattern of the regular expression.

---

The lookbehind should include the main pattern of the regular expression.

#### --answer--

The lookbehind should be placed to the left of the main pattern of the regular expression.

### --question--

#### --text--

---

`a{0,}`

#### --answer--

---

The `[]` character class can define a set of characters to match without the need to escape any special characters.

---

The `[]` character class represents a set of characters in Unicode form.

#### --answer--

The `[]` character class can define a custom set of characters to match.

### --question--

#### --text--

---

`[a-z]`

---

`[AZ]`

#### --answer--

`[A-Z]`

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a capturing group `(...)` is used in a regular expression?

#### --distractors--

The capturing group is immediately evaluated, regardless of where it is located in the regular expression.

---

The capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues without memorizing the result.

---

The capturing group is a prioritized subpattern, which will immediately return when a match is found for the subpattern.

#### --answer--

The capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues with the result in memory.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a non-capturing group `(?:...)` is used in a regular expression?

#### --distractors--

The non-capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues with the result in memory.

---

The non-capturing group immediately terminates when it finds a match for the given subpattern.

---

The non-capturing group is considered an optional match, so only a successful match is added on the result.

#### --answer--

The non-capturing group attempts to match using the given subpattern, and continues without memorizing the result.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when a backreference (`\1`, `\2`, etc.) is used in a regular expression?

#### --distractors--

The backreference imports a different regular expression as a sub-pattern.

---

The backreference copies the sub-pattern used in a previous capturing group.

---

The backreference implicitly includes the match from a previous capture group to prevent the regular expression from failing.

#### --answer--

The backreference includes the result from a capture group as part of a pattern/sub-pattern to match.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which part of the following regular expression causes errors?

```js
/(?:Expense|Asset) \$\d+\.\d{2} \1 \$\d+\.\d{2}/
```

#### --distractors--

The regular expression does not make use of the whitespace character class `\s`.

---

The regular expression allows 1 or more numbers after the $.

---

The regular expression escapes the `.` and `$`.

#### --answer--

The regular expression is attempting to use a backreference to a non-capturing group.
