與 Anna 談話後，Brian 擬出了以下政策的初稿：

**`Policy Update Draft`**

`To align with our flexible work model, the policy no longer includes fixed in-office days. Employees can choose their work location, as long as they meet their responsibilities.`

`We have added new communication guidelines for remote work. Team members should check in daily via our company platform and respond to messages within a reasonable time during work hours.`

`The annual leave request system has been simplified. Employees will now complete a short online form that goes directly to their manager for quick approval.`

`We also encourage all employees to take part in professional development. Courses, workshops, or learning new tools are all ways to grow skills. Managers will support team members in choosing useful learning paths.`

`These updates will be reviewed by team leaders next week. After that, the final version will be shared with the whole company.`
