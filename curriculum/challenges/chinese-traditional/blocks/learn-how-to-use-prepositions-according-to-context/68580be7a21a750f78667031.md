`James: Perfect, thanks! Lastly, I need some Ethernet cables. Any idea where those ended up?`

`Sarah: Actually, yes. They are a bit BLANK — go to the server room, but instead of going BLANK, turn right just before the door. There's a closet there where we're keeping all cables and related accessories.`
