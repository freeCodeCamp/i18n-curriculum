## --sentence--

`Alice: Good morning, David. Since Maria is at the conference this week, I'll be walking you through the BLANK for our project phases.`

`David: Morning, Alice. That sounds good. Can you start with how our budget is currently allocated across the different phases?`

`Alice: Absolutely. As of now, 45% of our total budget has been allocated to the development phase. Specifically, BLANK of this portion is directed towards back-end development, which is crucial given our scalability goals.`

`David: And what about the front-end and design aspects?`

`Alice: The front-end development and BLANK design together consume about 27% of the overall budget. Half of that is dedicated to BLANK enhancements, ensuring the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.`

`David: I see. How are we doing with the testing phase?`

`Alice: Testing has been allocated 13% of the budget. This covers everything from initial unit tests to final quality assurance checks before launch. We believe investing here is essential to ensure a stable release.`

`David: What fraction of our resources is still available for BLANK?`

`Alice: We have set aside 15% of the budget as a contingency. This should cover any unexpected costs during the later stages of the project.`

`David: That's reassuring. Can you tell me how much we've spent to date?`

`Alice: Up to this point, we've used about 40% of the total budget. Most of that was in the BLANK and early development stages.`

`David: Great, thanks for the BLANK, Alice. It's helpful to see how our resources are being managed. Let's keep a close eye on our spending as we move forward.`

`Alice: Will do, David. I'll make sure to update you regularly and adjust our allocations as needed based on our progress.`
