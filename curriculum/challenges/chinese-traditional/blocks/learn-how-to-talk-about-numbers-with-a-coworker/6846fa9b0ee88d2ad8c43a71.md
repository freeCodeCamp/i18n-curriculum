`Deployment` means releasing or launching software so it can be used in a real environment. 例如：

`We're planning the next deployment for Thursday.` — The team will release new changes on Thursday.

`Documentation` is written information that helps explain how something works or how to use it. 例如：

`The software needs better documentation.` — The instructions or user guide should be clearer.

Together, `deployment documentation` means the written steps and instructions needed to launch the software correctly.
