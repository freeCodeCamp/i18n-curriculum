想象有人写了 Lisa 和 Mark 之间会议的会议记录。这些是所做的笔记。

`Lisa and Mark discussed the recent database crash that happened last week. Lisa mentioned that after reviewing the logs, she realized the system overload might have been prevented if they had monitored the system load more closely. Mark agreed and added that the logs showed an unusually high number of queries hitting the database just before the crash. He suggested that if these queries had been spread more evenly, the system might not have failed.`

`Lisa also pointed out that they hadn't updated their database management software for some time. She believed that if the latest patches had been installed, some of the vulnerabilities exploited during the crash could have been fixed. Mark shared the same thought and expressed frustration that they had not prioritized the update earlier, which might have prevented the problem.`

`Finally, Lisa noted that although the situation was difficult, it was an important lesson. She asked how they could avoid such issues in the future, emphasizing the need for a more proactive maintenance strategy.`

在第一段中查找提到 Mark 和他的建议的部分。使用了 `Third Conditional` 的结构，这意味着所提到的事情实际上并未发生——它只是如果采取了不同的行动路线时可能的结果。通过读取这句话，你将能够正确回答这个问题。
