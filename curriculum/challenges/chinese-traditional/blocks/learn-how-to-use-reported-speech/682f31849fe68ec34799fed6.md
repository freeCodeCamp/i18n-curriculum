## --sentence--

`Sophie: Hi Brian, I just spoke with Jake about the security breach we had last week. He told me we experienced a BLANK attack that targeted several team members.`

`Brian: That sounds serious. What did Jake say?`

`Sophie: He said that the team responded quickly once the breach was detected. Jake mentioned that they managed to isolate the affected systems BLANK minutes, which limited the damage.`

`Brian: Good to hear they contained it quickly. Did Jake give any feedback on how we can prevent similar BLANK in the future?`

`Sophie: Yes, he suggested several steps. First, Jake thinks we should update our security training to cover more about phishing detection. He also said that we need to conduct regular security BLANK more frequently.`

`Brian: That makes sense. Did he mention anything about the team's BLANK reaction?`

`Sophie: He did. Jake said that while the team did well to respond quickly, there was some confusion about who was responsible for what during the incident. He believes better role clarity in our incident response plan could help.`

`Brian: That's an important point. We should definitely incorporate that feedback into our next training session. Can you write up a BLANK of this discussion? I'd like to use it to update our training materials.`

`Sophie: Of course, I'll get that done. Jake also emphasized the importance of maintaining our software updates to prevent BLANK. He explained that the breach exploited an outdated system component.`

`Brian: Right. Thanks for the update, Sophie. I'll make sure we address these points in our upcoming workshops.`
