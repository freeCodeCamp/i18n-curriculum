`Mark: Yes, we BLANK. Some users are complaining that they can't log in. Did you figure out what's causing the problem?`

`Alice: I think it's related to our session management. The tokens aren't being refreshed properly, are they?`

`Mark: That seems to be the case. The system is supposed to renew tokens every 30 minutes, BLANK it?`

`Alice: Yes, it should. But something's going wrong. Are you going to check the server logs to find out what happened?`

`Mark: Sure. We can do some tests on the staging server, BLANK we?`

`Alice: Yes, we can. That should give us more information. By the way, have the support tickets been piling up because of this?`

`Mark: Unfortunately, yes. We need to resolve this quickly, BLANK we?`

`Alice: Absolutely. Let's work together to find a solution. We don't want our users getting frustrated, BLANK we?`

`Mark: No, we don't. Okay, let's get to work and see if we can sort this out.`
