# --description--

我们用 `do` 询问日常事务。

使用组助动词 `do` 构成疑问句时，主要动词应保持一般形式不变。 例如：

- Statement: `She works as a full-stack dev.`

- Question: `Does she work as a full-stack dev?`

Notice in the question above that `work` doesn't change to `works`, even when asking about a third person singular subject like `he`, `she`, or `it`.
