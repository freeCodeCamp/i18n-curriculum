## --sentence--

`David: Anna, I heard your company is embracing 100% remote work. I'm not sure that's the best approach. Doesn't it create a BLANK among team members?`

`Anna: I see where you're coming from, David. But we've found that asynchronous remote work offers BLANK. It allows people to work in a way that suits their BLANK and personal life.`

`David: I understand. But isn't it challenging to manage BLANK with everyone working at different times? It seems like it could lead to a lot of BLANK.`

`Anna: That's a valid point. However, we've been using collaboration tools to keep everyone connected. It takes some adjustment, but once people get used to it, it works quite well.`

`David: I see your perspective, but I still think there's value in having everyone in the office. It builds BLANK and makes problem-solving easier.`

`Anna: True, but the office isn't the only place to build team spirit. We've found that virtual BLANK activities can be just as effective. How about trying some of those in your company?`

`David: That's a good suggestion, but I'm not sure I'd find much support for implementing it. Thanks for the idea, though.`

`Anna: Don't mention it. We have to do our best with what we have. `
