# --description--

Visual hierarchy refers to the way you layout and display the content of your page to guide the viewer's attention.

A strong hierarchy can provide a clear path for the eye to follow, ensuring that the information you convey is consumed in the order that you intended.

Let's consider a basic page layout in which the HTML for the page is semantically correct, but the styling applied does not create a strong visual hierarchy.

If the font size isn't distinct, there is no visible indication of the document flow, although things are separated by headings.

To create a visual hierarchy, you should apply different font sizes to the heading tiers. You could also use something like a "callout box" to highlight a specific section.

Visual hierarchy can also help increase your user conversion. For example, you can take advantage of the callout box to further draw attention to a Call to Action (CTA) button.

With the CTA button being visually tied to the work history section, it guides the user to the vital information and the action you want them to take based on that information.

Finally, your visual hierarchy can be important for conveying other components, like a navigation bar or a footer.

This makes it easier for your users to find the essential information that they may be looking for.
