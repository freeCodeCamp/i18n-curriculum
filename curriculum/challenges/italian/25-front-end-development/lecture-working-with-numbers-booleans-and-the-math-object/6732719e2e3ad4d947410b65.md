## --text--

How can you override operator precedence in JavaScript?

## --answers--

By using the addition operator (`+`) to change the order of operations.

### --feedback--

Think about how you change the order of operations in math equations.

---

By using parentheses to force certain parts of the expression to be evaluated first.

---

## --text--

How does JavaScript evaluate expressions with the exponent operator (`**`)?

## --answers--

From left to right.

### --feedback--

Think about the order in which exponentiation occurs in the expression.

---

From right to left, meaning it evaluates the rightmost exponentiation first.

---

By multiplying the base by itself the number of times indicated.

### --feedback--

Think about the order in which exponentiation occurs in the expression.

---

By adding the exponents together first, then calculating the result.
