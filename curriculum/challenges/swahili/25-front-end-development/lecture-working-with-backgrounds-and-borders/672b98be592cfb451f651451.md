# --description--

Watch the lecture video and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does the `circle` keyword specify in a `radial-gradient()` function?

## --answers--

The gradient will have a square shape.

### --feedback--

Consider what shape the gradient will take when using the `circle` keyword.

---

The gradient will extend in a diagonal direction.

### --feedback--

Consider what shape the gradient will take when using the `circle` keyword.

---

The gradient will have a circular shape.

---

The gradient will be applied to the text.

### --feedback--

Consider what shape the gradient will take when using the `circle` keyword.

## --text--

What does the `farthest-corner` keyword do in the size parameter of a `radial-gradient()` function?

## --answers--

It makes the gradient extend to the nearest corner of the element.

### --feedback--

Think about how the size of the gradient affects its coverage relative to the element.

---

It makes the gradient cover the entire element's `width`.

### --feedback--

Think about how the size of the gradient affects its coverage relative to the element.

---

It makes the gradient extend to the farthest corner of the element.

---

It makes the gradient only appear within the elementâ€™s `padding`.

### --feedback--

Think about how the size of the gradient affects its coverage relative to the element.

## --text--

In the `radial-gradient(circle at center, red, yellow 50%, green)` function, where is the gradient's center located?

## --answers--

At the top right corner of the element.

### --feedback--

Consider the placement specified by the at center part of the function.

---

At the bottom left corner of the element.

### --feedback--

Consider the placement specified by the at center part of the function.

---

At the center of the element.

---

At the outer edge of the element.

### --feedback--

Consider the placement specified by the at center part of the function.
