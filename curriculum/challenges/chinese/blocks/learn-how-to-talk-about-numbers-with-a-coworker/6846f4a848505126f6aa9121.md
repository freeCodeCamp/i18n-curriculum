## --sentence--

`Perfect. For the final phase, we should aim to have BLANK for beta testing and fixing any critical issues that our testers find.`

## --blanks--

`at least two weeks`

### --feedback--

These four words show the minimum amount of time needed.

# --explanation--

`Two` is a cardinal number. It tells you how many or how much.

`At least` means this is the minimum amount. You might need more, but not less. 例如：

`It will take at least two hours.` — The task won't take less than two hours.

So, `at least two weeks` means the team should plan for two weeks or more, not less.
