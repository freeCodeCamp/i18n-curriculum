# --explanation--

`Let's think about...` is used to suggest considering an idea or taking some time to reflect on a possible action.

When using `about`, the verb that follows it is in the `-ing` form. This is because `about` is a preposition, and after a preposition, you use the `-ing` form of the verb. 例如：

`Let's think about improving our workflow.` – Here, `improving` is in the `-ing` form because it's the verb following `about`.
