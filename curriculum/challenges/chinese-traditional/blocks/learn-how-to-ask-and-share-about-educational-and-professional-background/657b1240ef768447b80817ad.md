<!-- (Audio) Candidate: We were involved in the development of an e-commerce platform. We were responsible for the checkout process, and it was a successful implementation. -->

# --description--

如前所述，`Past Simple` 時態用於過去已完成的動作。

在這個背景關係中，`we were involved in` 結合了 `Past Simple` 時態（`were`）與表達式 `involved in`，其意指成為某事的零件，特別是在作用中的或重要的角色。為例：

`They were involved in organizing the event。`－這表示他們在組織該事件中扮演了重要角色。
