# --explanation--

`I've been meaning to ask about...` is a polite and natural way to bring up a question you've been wanting to ask for some time. It shows that the speaker hasn't forgotten and has been waiting for the right moment. 例如：

`I've been meaning to ask about your progress on the report.` – This means the speaker has wanted to ask this question before, but is only doing it now.
