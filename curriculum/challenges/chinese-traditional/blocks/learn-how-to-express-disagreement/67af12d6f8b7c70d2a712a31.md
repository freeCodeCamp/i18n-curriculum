在檢視遠端工作津貼的調查結果後，Bob 決定撰寫一篇文章：

`The Remote Work Stipend Debate: Comfort or Productivity?`

`A recent survey showed that remote workers have different opinions on how to use their work stipend. Most people want to spend it on office furniture, like a good chair and desk, to improve comfort and prevent back pain. Others believe that upgrading old computers is more important because slow devices can make work harder and less efficient.`

`So, what is more important — a better workspace or better technology?`

`A bad chair and desk can cause health problems and make it difficult to focus. But an outdated computer can be just as frustrating, slowing down work and reducing productivity.`

`The best solution might be to allow the stipend to cover both. This way, employees can choose what they need most to stay comfortable and work efficiently.`

`As remote work grows, companies need to support their workers in the best way possible. A well-equipped home office isn't just a nice extra — it's key to doing great work.`
