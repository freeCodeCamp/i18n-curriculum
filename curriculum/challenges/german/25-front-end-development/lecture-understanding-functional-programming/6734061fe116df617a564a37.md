## --text--

In the context of currying, what is partial application?

## --answers--

Applying a function to only some of its arguments.

---

### --feedback--

Recall what we said about "fixing" some arguments to a function.

---

Creating a new function from scratch.

### --feedback--

Recall what we said about "fixing" some arguments to a function.

## --text--

What is a potential drawback of overusing currying in your code?

## --answers--

It always makes the code run slower.

### --feedback--

Remember what we mentioned about the readability of heavily curried code.

---

It can make the code harder to read.

---

It reduces the reusability of functions.

### --feedback--

Remember what we mentioned about the readability of heavily curried code.

---
