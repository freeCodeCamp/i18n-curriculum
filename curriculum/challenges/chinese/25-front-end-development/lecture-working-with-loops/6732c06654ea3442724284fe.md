# --description--

Watch the lecture video and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the main difference between a `while` loop and a `do...while` loop?

## --answers--

A `while` loop executes the code block at least once, whereas a `do...while` loop does not.

### --feedback--

Consider which loop executes its code block before checking the condition.

---

A `do...while` loop executes the code block at least once, whereas a `while` loop does not.

---

A `while` loop and a `do...while` loop are exactly the same and have no differences.

### --feedback--

Consider which loop executes its code block before checking the condition.

---

A `while` loop checks the condition after executing the code block, whereas a `do...while` loop checks the condition before.

### --feedback--

Consider which loop executes its code block before checking the condition.

## --text--

In which situation would you prefer to use a `do...while` loop over a `while` loop?

## --answers--

When you need to execute a block of code zero or more times.

### --feedback--

Think about which loop guarantees at least one execution of its code block.

---

When you need to execute a block of code at least once before checking the condition.

---

When the number of iterations is known beforehand.

### --feedback--

Think about which loop guarantees at least one execution of its code block.

---

When you want to ensure the loop never executes.

### --feedback--

Think about which loop guarantees at least one execution of its code block.

## --text--

What happens if the condition in a `while` loop is initially `false`?

## --answers--

The code block inside the loop will execute once and then stop.

### --feedback--

Review what occurs if the condition is not met at the start of a `while` loop.

---

The code block inside the loop will not execute at all.

---

The code block inside the loop will execute indefinitely.

### --feedback--

Review what occurs if the condition is not met at the start of a `while` loop.

---

The loop will terminate immediately and produce an error.

### --feedback--

Review what occurs if the condition is not met at the start of a `while` loop.
