## --sentence--

`Mark: Hey, Sophie. Thanks for letting me sit in on the code review. I heard some terms that were BLANK. Can I ask you about a few of them?`

`Sophie: Sure, Mark. What's on your mind?`

`Mark: Well, you mentioned "polymorphism." I think it means a code structure that can have BLANK shapes or forms. Is that right?`

`Sophie: BLANK. "Polymorphism" refers to a function or object that can behave differently depending on the context. It's not just about having different shapes, but about being flexible in how it operates.`

`Mark: Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining. I also heard "encapsulation." BLANK breaking code into smaller parts, like encapsulating it?`

`Sophie: BLANK. "Encapsulation" is about keeping some details hidden to make the code easier to work with. Think of it as wrapping code to limit what other parts can see.`

`Mark: BLANK. And what about "inheritance"? Does this mean passing down code from one project to another?`

`Sophie: Not exactly. "Inheritance" is when one class inherits properties and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse and extending functionality within a project.`

`Mark: Thanks for clarifying. And "abstraction"? Does it mean simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details?`

`Sophie: Yes, BLANK. "Abstraction" is about reducing complexity by showing only what's necessary, keeping the details hidden.`

`Mark: At least I got one right! I think I'm starting to understand these terms better. Thanks for the explanations, Sophie.`
