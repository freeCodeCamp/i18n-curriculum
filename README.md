This repository holds the translations for freeCodeCamp's curriculum. It's designed to be used as a submodule of the main freeCodeCamp repo.

There are three actions,
One to download the curriculum files twice a week,
One to automatically merge those PR's
And another to update the submodule on the freeCodeCamp repo.
