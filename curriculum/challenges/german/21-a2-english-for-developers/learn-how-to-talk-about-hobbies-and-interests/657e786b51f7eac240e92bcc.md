# --description--

Die Phrase `would you like` ist ein höflicher Weg, etwas anzubieten oder jemanden zu fragen ob er etwas möchte. Wenn du etwas anbietest, kannst du es direkt nach dem Ausdruck `would you like` spezifizieren.

For instance, you might ask `Would you like some coffee?` when offering coffee to a guest.

If you are proposing to do something, such as `going shopping`, remember to include `to` between the expression and the action.

For example: `Would you like to go shopping?`. Finally, if you are asking someone if you should do something for them, use `me` between `would you like` and `to`. For example: `Would you like me to make some coffee?`.
