# --description--

Watch the lecture video and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which function can you use to define the range for the size of a grid track?

## --answers--

`clamp()`

### --feedback--

This function is for clamping a value between a minimum and maximum but doesn't define grid track ranges.

---

`minmax()`

---

`max-width()`

### --feedback--

This property sets the maximum width of an element, not a grid track range.

---

`calc()`

### --feedback--

This function performs calculations but doesn't define grid track ranges.

## --text--

Which of the following best describes how the grid track size behaves when using the `minmax()` function?

## --answers--

The grid track size is fixed between the minimum and maximum values.

### --feedback--

The grid track size adjusts dynamically, not fixed, between the given min and max values.

---

The grid track size adjusts dynamically between the min and max values based on content and container size.

---

The grid track size will always be set to the maximum value, regardless of content.

### --feedback--

The grid track size adjusts based on both the min and max values, not just the maximum.

---

The grid track size only responds to content, not container size.

### --feedback--

The size adjusts dynamically based on both content and container size.

## --text--

What does the min and max value in the `minmax()` function control?

## --answers--

The min value allows shrinking, and the max value sets a fixed size.

### --feedback--

The min value prevents shrinking below the specified size, and the max value limits growth.

---

The min value ensures the grid track won't shrink below a set size, and the max value limits how large it can grow.

---

The min value limits growth, and the max value determines the smallest size.

### --feedback--

The max value limits growth, and the min value ensures a minimum size, not the other way around.

---

Both values set fixed sizes for the grid track.

### --feedback--

The min and max values define a range, not fixed sizes.
