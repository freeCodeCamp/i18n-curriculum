## --sentence--

`Anna: Brian, we really need to BLANK the updates to our remote work policy. There's been a lot of back and forth on what should be included.`

`Brian: Absolutely, Anna. It's crucial that we iron out these details soon. Let's start by phasing out the old clause about mandatory in-office days. It's not fitting our current model.`

`Anna: I agree. We should also BLANK some guidelines for communication during remote work. Making sure that everyone is on the same page will help streamline our operations.`

`Brian: Definitely. On another note, we need to BLANK the employee feedback regarding annual leave. Some people feel like the process to apply is a bit inefficient.`

`Anna: That's a good point. Perhaps we can simplify it by cutting down unnecessary steps. Making it easy to apply should encourage more people to BLANK they need without feeling bogged down.`

`Brian: Right, and while we're at it, let's wrap up the section on professional development. We should encourage staff to branch out in their skills without making it sound too daunting.`

`Anna: Great idea, Brian. Encouraging growth is key. How about we put together a draft of these changes and BLANK the team leads before we BLANK company-wide?`

`Brian: Sounds like a plan. I'll draft up the changes and BLANK a meeting with the team leads next week. We can iron out any kinks, then get everyone's buy-in.`

`Anna: Perfect, Brian. Thanks for helping to make these policies clearer. It's important that they reflect our company's values and current work environment.`

`Brian: My pleasure, Anna. Let's make sure these policies do just that.`
