`Bob: What about the integration with other systems? Has it been seamless?`

`Linda: Not entirely. It's had issues connecting with our older devices, but we're working on it. The development team has been BLANK.`

`Bob: That's a good start. By the way, have we tested it with real users yet?`

`Linda: Not yet, but we plan to. I think it would be helpful to get some BLANK before we roll it out completely.`
