## --sentence--

`Sarah: Hi, Tom. Thanks for submitting your code for review. Let's BLANK together.`

`Tom: Sure. I'm still trying to understand the code structure here.`

`Sarah: No worries. That's what BLANK are for. First, I'd suggest that you format the code consistently. It'll be easier for everyone to read.`

`Tom: Got it. So if I indent the blocks consistently, it improves code readability?`

`Sarah: Exactly. Consistent indentation makes the code visually organized. It's a BLANK. It also helps maintainability. Now, let's BLANK error handling. If you encounter potential issues, it's BLANK to use conditional statements to handle them gracefully.`

`Tom: So I should include conditional statements BLANK them?`

`Sarah: Absolutely. It prevents unexpected crashes and provides a better user experience. To finish, BLANK the comments. If you include comments when they're necessary, it helps future developers understand the logic.`

`Tom: I see. So by explaining the BLANK with comments, I'll help other people understand the code better. Is that right?`

`Sarah: Precisely. It's a form of documentation within the code. Great job grasping these concepts.`

`Tom: Thanks. And great tips, by the way. I'll make those suggested changes and BLANK again.`
