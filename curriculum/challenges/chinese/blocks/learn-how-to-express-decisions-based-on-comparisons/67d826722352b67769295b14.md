在他们对话一个月后，Brian 给 Sarah 发送了一封电子邮件：  

`Hi Sarah,`  

`I hope you're doing well. I wanted to update you on our software development project.`  

`We decided to build the core parts in-house and outsource the rest. This has worked well. The in-house team has stronger control, while outsourcing has made things faster.`  

`There were some challenges. Communication with the external team was difficult at first, but regular check-ins helped. Our team also needed more support, so we reassigned some resources.`  

`Overall, this approach is more reliable than full outsourcing because we control key parts while saving time. However, we are still improving our process.`  

`Thanks again for your suggestion! Let's catch up soon.`  

`Best,`

`Brian`
