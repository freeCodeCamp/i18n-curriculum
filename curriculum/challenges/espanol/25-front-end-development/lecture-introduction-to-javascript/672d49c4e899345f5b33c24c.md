What is `console.log()` used for, and how does it work?

In JavaScript, `console.log()` is a simple yet powerful tool used to display messages or output information to the browser's console. It's mostly used by developers to debug and inspect code while working on their programs.

You can use `console.log()` to log text or variables to the console and ensure your code is running correctly.

To use `console.log()`, you call the method with the value or message you want to output inside the parentheses. Here are some examples:

```js
console.log("Hello, world!");

let num = 5;
console.log(num);
```

The first example prints `Hello, world!` in the browser's console, while the second example prints the value `5`.

Here is another example of working with `console.log()`:

```js
let name = "Alice";
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!"); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

The `console.log()` method helps you monitor your code as it runs, making it easier to spot mistakes and understand how your program behaves.
