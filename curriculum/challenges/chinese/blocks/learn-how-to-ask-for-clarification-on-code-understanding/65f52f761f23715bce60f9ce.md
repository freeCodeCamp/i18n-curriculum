## --text--

What part of Sarah's answer suggests a course of action?

## --answers--

`I can take a look at it`

### --feedback--

While this shows willingness to help, it doesn't specify the first action Sarah wants to take.

---

`Sure, Tom`

### --反馈--

This is a simple acknowledgment, not a suggestion for action.

---

`Let's start by identifying the issue`

---

`I can take a look at it later`

### --反馈--

This option is not present in Sarah's response and doesn't suggest an immediate course of action.
