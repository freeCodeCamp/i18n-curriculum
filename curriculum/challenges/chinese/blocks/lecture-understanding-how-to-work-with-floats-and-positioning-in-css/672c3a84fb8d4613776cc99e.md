# --description--

In CSS, positioning allows us to control how elements are laid out on a page. Two common types of positioning are static positioning and relative positioning. By default, elements are statically positioned. This means they follow the normal flow of the document, one after another, from top to bottom, left to right.

Static positioning is the default for all elements and doesn't need any special declaration in CSS. You won’t notice anything different when using static positioning because it just keeps elements where they naturally occur in the document. Here is an example of a paragraph using default static positioning:

```html
<p>This paragraph is statically positioned.</p>
```

When rendered in the browser, this paragraph will appear in its natural position, following the normal document flow. No special styling is applied to move it, and it remains where it would naturally appear in the layout.

Relative positioning, on the other hand, allows an element to be shifted from its normal position without disrupting the flow of the document. Think of it as moving the element from its default static position by giving it new coordinates. Here is how you might apply relative positioning:

```css
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      border: solid 1px black;
    }
    .relative {
      position: relative;
      top: 30px;
      left: 30px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="relative">This paragraph is positioned relatively.</p>
</body>
```

In this example, the paragraph will appear `30px` down and `30px` to the right from its original position. However, the space it would have occupied in the normal flow remains preserved. Relative positioning is very useful when you want to move an element slightly without affecting the rest of the layout.
