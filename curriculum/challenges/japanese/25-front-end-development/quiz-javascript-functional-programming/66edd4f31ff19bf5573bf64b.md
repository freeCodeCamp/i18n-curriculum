### --question--

#### --text--

What is a pure function?

#### --distractors--

A function that modifies global variables

---

A function that prints to the console

---

A function that changes its behavior based on external factors

#### --answer--

A function that always returns the same output for the same input and produces no side effects

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is a characteristic of a pure function?

#### --distractors--

It has side effects

---

It relies on global state

---

It modifies its input parameters

An unexpected error in the code

---

A function that takes too long to execute

---

A recursive function call

#### --answer--

A change in program state or interaction with the outside world

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is an example of a side effect?

#### --distractors--

Returning a value from a function

---

Creating a new object within a function

---

Using a local variable

#### --answer--

Writing to a file

### --question--

#### --text--

What is currying in functional programming?

#### --distractors--

A technique for cooking functions

---

A method for optimizing recursive functions

---

A way to combine multiple functions into one

#### --answer--

The process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument

### --question--

#### --text--

In the context of pure functions, what does "referential transparency" mean?

#### --distractors--

The function's code is visible to other parts of the program

---

The function references external variables transparently

---

The function's name clearly indicates its purpose

#### --answer--

The function can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using pure functions?

#### --distractors--

Easier to test

---

More predictable behavior

---

Easier to reason about

#### --answer--

Improved performance in all cases

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the output of this pure function?

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(2, 5));
```

#### --distractors--

`3`

---

`4`

---

`undefined`

#### --answer--

`7`

### --question--

#### --text--

Which statement about currying is true?

#### --distractors--

Currying always improves performance

---

Curried functions are always pure functions

---

Currying is only possible in functional programming languages

#### --answer--

Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions

### --question--

#### --text--

What is a potential side effect of the following function?

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```

#### --distractors--

It modifies a global variable

---

It changes the input parameter

---

It returns a value

#### --answer--

It interacts with the console (I/O operation)

### --question--

#### --text--

In functional programming, what is function composition?

#### --distractors--

Writing functions with multiple arguments

---

Declaring functions inside other functions

---

Using arrow function syntax

#### --answer--

Combining two or more functions to create a new function

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is an example of a pure function?

#### --distractors--

```javascript
const random = () => Math.random();
```

---

```javascript
const log = (x) => console.log(x);
```

---

```javascript
let count = 0;
const increment = () => ++count;
```

#### --answer--

```javascript
const double = (x) => x * 2;
```

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the primary goal of currying?

#### --distractors--

To improve code readability

---

To create functions with fewer arguments

---

To eliminate the need for higher-order functions

#### --answer--

To enable partial application of functions

### --question--

#### --text--

Which statement about side effects is FALSE?

#### --distractors--

Side effects make code harder to test

---

Reading from a database can be considered a side effect

#### --answer--

Pure functions can have side effects

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the result of currying the following function?

const add = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
```

#### --distractors--

```javascript
const curried = (a, b, c) => a() + b() + c();
```

---

```javascript
const curried = a => (b, c) => a + b + c;
```

---

```javascript
const curried = (a, b) => c => a + b + c;
```

#### --answer--

```javascript
const curried = a => b => c => a + b + c;
```

### --question--

#### --text--
