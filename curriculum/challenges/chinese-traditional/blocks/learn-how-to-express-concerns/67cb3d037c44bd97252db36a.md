在與 Maria 談話後，Bob 決定寄一封電子郵件給人力資源部門主管 Anna，安排會議。這是他寄出的訊息：

`Subject: Urgent: Team Support and Deadline Challenges`

`Hi Anna,`

`I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out about some challenges our team is facing with the new deadline.`

`Right now, the team is feeling overwhelmed. They are already working extra hours, and adding more tasks could lead to burnout. One key issue is that we are short on important roles, making it difficult to meet the deadline. More support would help balance the workload and reduce stress.`

`Another concern is communication. The team often hears about changes too late, which causes confusion. We are setting up regular check-ins to improve this, but having enough people in place would make a big difference.`

`To help the team, we may need to adjust the deadline slightly. However, even with more time, we still need additional resources. I'd like to discuss possible solutions with you. Could we set up a meeting to go over this?`

`Let me know when you're available. Looking forward to your thoughts.`

`Best,`

`Bob`

Bob 評論說團隊在 `short on important roles`。有更多人員在團隊中工作將有助於平衡工作負載並減輕壓力。由於電子郵件是寄給人力資源部門，因此可以推斷主要的請求是增加人手。
