## --sentence--

`Sophie: So, I'm here BLANK I feel sleepy during the mornings. I BLANK productive until it's almost midday. Do you have any tips on how to have a healthy morning routine?`

`Expert: Absolutely. My first suggestion is BLANK hit the snooze button multiple times. It may be tempting, but it disrupts your sleep cycle and you may feel groggy during the day. Set one alarm and get up when it rings.`

`Sophie: That's a good point. What else?`

`Expert: Another thing: don't skip breakfast. Breakfast gives you the energy to start the day. If you skip it, you probably compensate later by eating BLANK or you feel sluggish in the morning. Have a balanced breakfast instead.`

`Sophie: I have a friend who does that in her routine. Any other suggestions?`

`Expert: Yes. BLANK your day by checking your phone or emails immediately. It creates stress and makes you feel like you have to rush. Take a few minutes for yourself. For example, you can stretch or do some breathing exercises to clear your mind.`

`Sophie: That's a good idea.`

`Expert: One more thing: don't rush during your morning routine. Give yourself time to get ready without BLANK. If you start the day feeling relaxed, you may have a more productive day.`

`Sophie: Wow, thanks. I'll BLANK these changes into my morning routine.`

`Expert: You're welcome. And remember: the small changes make a big difference. Your morning starts well when you have a good night's sleep. BLANK get enough sleep to feel well-rested in the morning. Have a great morning.`
