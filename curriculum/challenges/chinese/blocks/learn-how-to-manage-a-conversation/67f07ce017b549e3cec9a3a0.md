## --sentence--

`Brian: Hey, Sarah. I wanted to discuss an BLANK project with you. It's been a while since we last checked in. How's everything going on your end?`

`Sarah: Hi, Brian. Everything is progressing, but we have a few challenges. Some parts of the project are BLANK than expected. By the way, have you heard anything about the additional resources we requested?`

`Brian: Yes, I spoke with BLANK. We might get some support, but they're still deciding. Is there anything else slowing you down?`

`Sarah: Well, we've had some issues with the new BLANK. It's not as BLANK as we hoped. We're working on it, though. Speaking of which, do you know if there's a timeline for the next phase?`

`Brian: Not yet, but I can find out. We should probably plan a meeting with the team to discuss the integration issues. Would that help?`

`Sarah: Absolutely. Also, BLANK ask about the new training sessions. When do they start? I think the team could really use some refreshers on the new tools.`

`Brian: Good point. The training sessions are scheduled for next week. I'll send you the details. Anything else you'd like to discuss?`

`Sarah: Not for now. Thanks, Brian. I appreciate the update. If anything comes up, I'll let you know.`

`Brian: Sounds good. Feel free to BLANK to me if you need anything else.`
