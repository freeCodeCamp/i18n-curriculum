## --sentence--

`Sarah: Thanks for meeting with me today. We need to wrap up the list of components for our next product batch. This list here shows what we're looking at.`

`Josh: No problem at all. I see this item at the top — do you need many of BLANK, or just a few?`

`Sarah: We're actually looking for BLANK of those. They're crucial for our new design. Last time, we ordered twenty. This time we might need double that.`

`Josh: Got it. BLANK resistors right there — are they the same ones you needed last time, or something better?`

`Sarah: Those are the ones. But, we found something BLANK in your catalog, these BLANK ones here. Could we get a sample of those first before we make a large order?`

`Josh: Certainly, I can send those over by next week. How about these cables? You mentioned needing more than usual.`

`Sarah: Yes, those cables were BLANK short last time. We need something longer. Maybe twice as long as the ones we got before.`

`Josh: Understood. I'll check what lengths we have in stock. For these connectors, are these standard types BLANK, or do you need the highest quality we offer?`

`Sarah: We'd prefer the highest quality for those connectors since they impact the product's performance significantly. Also, could you ensure we receive all the materials by the end of the month?`

`Josh: Absolutely, I'll prioritize these orders. I'll draft a quote with these specifics and send it over to you by tomorrow. Does that work for you?`

`Sarah: Perfect, Josh. Thank you for the BLANK. Let's touch base once I review the quote.`
