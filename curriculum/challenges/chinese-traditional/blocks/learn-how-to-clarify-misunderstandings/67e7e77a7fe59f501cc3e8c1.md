# --explanation--

In the sentence `the developer explained how the algorithm works`, a noun clause is used correctly as the object of the verb `explained`. The noun clause provides detailed information about what the developer explained.

Other sentences either misuse word order in the noun clause or have incomplete verb structures, making them grammatically incorrect.
