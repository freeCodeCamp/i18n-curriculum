What will be the output of the following code?

```js
let str = "  HELLO world  ";
let result = str.trim().toLowerCase().split(' ');
console.log(result);
```

## --answers--

`["HELLO", "world"]`

### --feedback--

Consider the effect of each method in the chain: `trim()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `split()`.

---

`["hello", "world"]`

---

`"hello world"`

let obj = {
    value: 1,
    increment: function() {
        this.value++;
        return this;
    },
    double: function() {
        this.value *= 2;
        return this;
    },
    getValue: function() {
        return this.value;
    }
};

let result = obj.increment().double().increment().getValue();
console.log(result);
```
