## --sentence--

`Jessica: Good morning, James. Today, we need to compare two versions of our software. Let's start with how they look. The new one seems BLANK and cleaner than the old one.`

`James: Yes, Jessica. I agree. The new version not only looks better but also BLANK. It's faster and responds quicker when we do things on it.`

`Jessica: That's good to hear. What about how stable they are? Does the new version work without stopping or crashing?`

`James: The new version is BLANK stable. We've seen fewer problems and it doesn't stop working as much. It can handle more data now, which is much better.`

`Jessica: Great. How about adjusting to different screen sizes? The old version was BLANK at this, but the new one is even better, right?`

`James: Yes, it changes size really well. It works great on different devices. Everything adjusts by itself and looks good, which makes it BLANK to use.`

`Jessica: That's good. And installing it, is it faster now?`

`James: Yes, it now installs much quicker. It's easy for users to start using it immediately after they download it. The setup is simple, which helps a lot.`

`Jessica: That's a good improvement. Have people reported BLANK with this new version?`

`James: Yes, there are fewer big problems now. Most issues are small and not so serious. It looks like we fixed many of the big problems from before.`

`Jessica: That sounds good. Lastly, can the new version handle more users than the old one?`

`James: Definitely. The new version can support more users and handle BLANK at once. We've made sure it can grow as more users join without slowing down.`

`Jessica: Fantastic, James. I'll put all this information into a report and talk about it with the team tomorrow. This feedback should help us know what to do next.`

`James: I'm glad to help. Let me know if you need BLANK for the report.`
