#### --distractors--

A way to execute code in a sequential order.

---

A technique to handle errors in synchronous code.

---

A way to guarantee task order.

#### --answer--

A method to execute code concurrently without blocking the main thread.

### --question--

#### --text--

What does the `async` attribute do when used in a `<script>` tag?

#### --distractors--

It allows the script to be executed after the HTML document has been completely parsed.

---

It ensures the script runs in a synchronous manner.

---

It delays the script execution until the browser is idle.

#### --answer--

The script is downloaded in parallel with parsing the page and executed as soon as it is available.

To manage asynchronous callbacks.

---

To create and manage cookies.

---

`DELETE`

---

`HEAD`

#### --answer--

### --question--

#### --text--

What does the `res.json()` method do in Express.js?

#### --distractors--

It retrieves data from a JSON file.

---

It parses a JSON string into a JavaScript object.

---

It sends raw JSON as a response without any processing.

#### --answer--

It converts a JavaScript object to a JSON string and sends it as a response.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is a promise in JavaScript?

#### --distractors--

A way to synchronize multiple operations.

---

A callback function that runs after an operation.

---

A technique to handle errors in asynchronous code.

#### --answer--

An object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.

### --question--

#### --text--

What does promise chaining allow you to do?

#### --distractors--

Execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel.

---

Handle synchronous operations more efficiently.

---

Retry failed operations automatically.

#### --answer--

Pass the result of one promise to the next.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which method is used to handle successful completion of a promise?

#### --distractors--

`.finally()`

---

`.catch()`

---

`.error()`

#### --text--

Which method is used to handle errors in a promise chain?

#### --distractors--

`.finally()`

---

`.then()`

---

`.error()`

#### --answer--

`.catch()`

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the use of the `.finally()` method in a promise?

#### --distractors--

It returns the result of the promise.

---

It stops the execution of subsequent promise handlers.

---

It retries the promise if it fails.

#### --answer--

It executes code after a promise is fulfilled or rejected, regardless of the outcome.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the syntax for declaring an async function?

#### --distractors--

`function myFunction() {}`

---

`function async myFunction() {}`

---

`async {} => ()`

#### --answer--

`async function myFunction() {}`

### --question--

#### --text--

What does the `await` keyword do in an async function?

#### --distractors--

It creates a new promise.

---

It executes code immediately without waiting.

---

It returns the result of the promise.

#### --answer--

It pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the purpose of the Geolocation API?

#### --distractors--

To manipulate HTML elements.

---

To create and manage map elements.

---

To control the device's camera.

#### --answer--

To retrieve the geographical location of a device.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which method of the Geolocation API is used to get the current position of the device?

#### --distractors--

`getLocation()`

---

`getPosition()`

---

`getLatLong()`

#### --answer--

`getCurrentPosition()`

### --question--

#### --text--

What parameters can be passed to the `getCurrentPosition()` method?

#### --distractors--

Only the success callback function.

---

Only options.

---

One the error callback function.

#### --answer--

Success and error callback functions, along with options.

### --question--

#### --text--

What will the following code return? `fetch('https://api.example.com/data')`

#### --distractors--

The JSON response directly.

---

An error if the URL is not reachable.

---

A synchronous response.

#### --answer--

A `Promise` that resolves to a `Response` object

### --question--

#### --text--

#### --distractors--

`POST`

---

`PUT`

---

`DELETE`

#### --answer--

`GET`

### --question--

#### --text--

What does the `Promise.all()` method do?

#### --distractors--

It resolves a single promise.

---

It rejects the first promise that fails.

---

It runs all promises sequentially.

#### --answer--

It executes multiple promises concurrently and returns the results when all are resolved.

### --question--

#### --text--

How do you handle multiple asynchronous operations using async/await?

#### --distractors--

You must always use `.then()` for each operation.

---

You cannot handle multiple operations with async/await.

---

You must use callback functions for all operations.

#### --answer--

You can use `await` for each operation in sequence and put them inside an async function.

### --question--
