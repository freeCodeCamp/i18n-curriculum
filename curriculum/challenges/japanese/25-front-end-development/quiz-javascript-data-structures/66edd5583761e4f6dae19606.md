---

Stays O(n)

---

Changes to O(log n) when resizing occurs

#### --text--

Which of the following is a property of a binary min-heap?

#### --distractors--

Tree is always balanced

---

Root contains the largest element

---

Elements are sorted in ascending order

#### --distractors--

They are resolved using sorting

---

They are impossible to occur

---

They can crash the program

#### --answer--

They are resolved using linked lists (chaining method) or open addressing

### --question--

#### --text--

#### --distractors--

O(1)

---

O(log n)

---

O(n log n)

#### --answer--

O(n)

#### --distractors--

O(n)

---

O(n log n)

---

O(log n)

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is used to implement a priority queue?

#### --distractors--

Stack

---

Queue

---

Linked List

#### --answer--

Heap

### --question--

#### --text--

In a doubly linked list, what does each node contain?

#### --distractors--

Data and only a pointer to the previous node

---

Data and a pointer to the next node

---

Data only

#### --answer--

Data and two pointers (next and previous nodes)

### --question--

#### --text--

The value of each node in a max-heap is:

#### --distractors--

Equal to its children

---

Unrelated to the value of its children

---

Less than or equal to the value of its children

#### --answer--

Greater than or equal to the value of its children

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is true for a singly linked list?

#### --distractors--

It allows traversal in both directions

---

Each node has two pointers

---

The list is circular by default

#### --answer--

Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the primary benefit of using a hash set over an array?

#### --distractors--

Reduced memory usage

---

Random access to elements

---

Maintaining order of elements

#### --answer--

Faster insertion and search times due to hash function

### --question--

#### --text--

Which operation is faster in a doubly linked list compared to a singly linked list?

#### --distractors--

Searching for an element

---

Reversing the list

---

Insertion at the end

#### --answer--

Deleting a node when a reference to that node is provided

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the main difference between a queue and a stack?

#### --distractors--

Stack allows random access while queue does not

---

Queue follows "Last in, first out" (LIFO) and stack follows "First in, first out" (FIFO)

---

Both follow the same order of operations

#### --answer--

Stack follows "Last in, first out" (LIFO) and queue follows "First in, first out" (FIFO)

#### --distractors--

O(log n)

---

O(n log n)

---

O(n)

#### --answer--

O(1)

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the order of insertion and deletion in a stack?

#### --distractors--

Random access

---

First in, last out (FILO)

---

First in, first out (FIFO)

#### --answer--

Last in, first out (LIFO)

### --question--

#### --text--

A set data structure:

#### --distractors--

Guarantees sorted order

---

Allows duplicate elements

---

Allows access by index

#### --answer--

Does not allow duplicate elements

### --question--

#### --text--

What differentiates a dynamic array from a static array?

#### --distractors--

Dynamic arrays require less memory than Static Arrays

---

Static arrays are always slower

---

Static arrays are only used in Java

#### --answer--

Dynamic arrays can grow whereas static arrays have fixed size
