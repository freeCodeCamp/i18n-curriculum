# --description--

Overflow refers to the way elements handle content that exceeds or overflows the size of the containing element. For example, the text content of a `div` element can overflow out of its borders.

Overflow is two-dimensional, the x-axis determines horizontal overflow, and the y-axis determines vertical overflow.

Let's fix the overflow on our example using the `overflow-y` CSS property. First we can hide the overflow entirely with `hidden` like this:

```css
div {
  overflow-y: hidden;
}
```

TThis resolves the overflow problem but now the extra content becomes completely unreachable. Instead we can use scroll to force the element to become scrollable:

```css
div {
  overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

Now this turns the container into a scrollable element, allowing all the content to be viewed by scrolling the element independently of the page scroll. We could also let the browser handle it on its own with `auto` value. It's worth noting that vertical scrolling is generally considered okay while horizontal scrolling might be questioned as it's generally not a common design decision.

With this knowledge, you can now control how your content overflows giving you more power over the layout of your pages.
