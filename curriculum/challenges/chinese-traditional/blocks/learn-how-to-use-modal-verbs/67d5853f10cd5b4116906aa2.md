## --text--

Which sentence is grammatically correct?

## --answers--

`You can explain the project details to me?`

### --feedback--

This sentence should be structured as a question.

---

`Can you explain the project details to me?`

---

`Can explains you the project details?`

### --feedback--

The modal verb `can` should be followed by the base form of the verb, not `explains`.

---

`Do can you explain the project details?`

### --feedback--

`Can` already acts as a helping verb, so `do` is not needed in the question.

# --explanation--

When forming a question with modal verbs, the structure is: modal verb + subject + base verb + (object)? 例如：

- `Can we complete the project by Friday?` - Asking if it's possible to finish the project by Friday.

- `Should we update the software to the latest version?` - Asking for advice or suggestion on whether to update the software.

In the correct answer, `can` is placed before the subject (`you`), and the verb (`explain`) is in its base form.
