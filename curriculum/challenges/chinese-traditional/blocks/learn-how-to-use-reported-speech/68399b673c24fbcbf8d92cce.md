想像有人為 Lisa 和 Mark 之間的會議撰寫了會議記錄。這些是所做的筆記。

`Lisa and Mark discussed the recent database crash that happened last week. Lisa mentioned that after reviewing the logs, she realized the system overload might have been prevented if they had monitored the system load more closely. Mark agreed and added that the logs showed an unusually high number of queries hitting the database just before the crash. He suggested that if these queries had been spread more evenly, the system might not have failed.`

`Lisa also pointed out that they hadn't updated their database management software for some time. She believed that if the latest patches had been installed, some of the vulnerabilities exploited during the crash could have been fixed. Mark shared the same thought and expressed frustration that they had not prioritized the update earlier, which might have prevented the problem.`

`Finally, Lisa noted that although the situation was difficult, it was an important lesson. She asked how they could avoid such issues in the future, emphasizing the need for a more proactive maintenance strategy.`

除了同時過多的查詢之外，Lisa 還指出了什麼可能導致當機的原因？

第二段以 Lisa 指出某件事開始。使用了 `Past Perfect` 結構，表示某件事在系統當機之前發生（或在此情況下，未發生）。這可能已修補了一些漏洞。找到使用 Past Perfect 的那一行，以找出此問題的正確答案。
