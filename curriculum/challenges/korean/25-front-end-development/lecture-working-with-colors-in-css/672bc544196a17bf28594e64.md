Watch the lecture video and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the difference between linear and radial gradients in CSS?

## --answers--

Linear gradients use only two colors, while radial gradients use multiple colors.

### --feedback--

Think about the shape and direction of each type of gradient.

---

Linear gradients transition along a straight line, while radial gradients radiate from a central point.

---

Linear gradients are only horizontal, while radial gradients can be any shape.

### --feedback--

Think about the shape and direction of each type of gradient.

---

Linear gradients are smoother than radial gradients.

### --feedback--
