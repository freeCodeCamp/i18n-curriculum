Jessica 在第二天给团队发送了一封电子邮件，总结了她与 James 关于新建软件版本的对话。

`Hi team,`

`Yesterday, I met with James to compare the old and new versions of our software. Below is a summary of our discussion and key points to consider:`

`- Overall Improvements`

`The new version looks cleaner and is easier to use. James mentioned that it not only looks better but also responds faster and works more smoothly during tasks.`

`- Stability`

`We both agreed the new version is much more stable. It doesn't crash as often, and we've seen fewer serious problems. Most of the remaining issues are small.`

`- Performance and Data Handling`

`The new version can handle more data and actions at once. We also made sure it can grow as more users join, without slowing down.`

`- Screen Sizes and Device Compatibility`

`The software adjusts well to different screen sizes and devices. Everything resizes by itself, making the experience nicer and more user-friendly.`

`- Installation and Setup`

`Installing the new version is much quicker. After downloading, users can start right away. The setup is simple, which helps reduce confusion.`

`- Feedback and Next Steps`

`This feedback will help guide our future updates. Please review this report and let me know if you have additional input. We'll use this to plan our next phase of improvements.`

`Thanks,`

`Jessica`
